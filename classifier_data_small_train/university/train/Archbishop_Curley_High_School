It is affiliated with the Franciscan religious order and is named in honor of Archbishop Michael J. Curley ( 1879â€“1947 ) , who served as the tenth Archbishop of Baltimore , from 1921 to 1947 . It was the first Archdiocesan high school in Baltimore established exclusively for the education of young men . The school was founded in 1960 under the leadership and direction of the late Archbishop Francis Patrick Keough . It opened in September 1961 with a class of 420 freshmen , and was dedicated on April 17 , 1962 , by Lawrence Cardinal Shehan , the successor of the late Archbishop Keough . The school was designed by local architect Edward H. Glidden and is located on a 33 - acre campus on the northeast edge of the City of Baltimore . The main three - story building contains classrooms , labs , administrative , guidance , alumni and development offices , two computer centers , a closed - circuit TV station , and the guidance resource center . Attached to the central structure are six wings that house the chapel , auditorium , gymnasium , student dining room , the library multi - media center , and the Friary , which is the residence of the Franciscan Friars at Archbishop Curley . Two smaller wings , added in 1987 , house the music department facilities and additional athletic facilities .
