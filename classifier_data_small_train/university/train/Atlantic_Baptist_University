Atlantic Baptist University is a small Liberal Arts university located in Moncton , New Brunswick , Canada . The school was founded in 1949 under the name United Baptist Bible Training School ( UBBTS ) , and served as both a secondary school and a Bible school . Over two decades , the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post - secondary programs . In 1968 , UBBTS became a Bible and Junior Christian Liberal Arts College , and in 1970 the name was changed to Atlantic Baptist College ( ABC ) . A sustained campaign to expand the school 's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full Bachelor of Arts degrees in the early 1980s . Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road , west of Moncton 's central business district . The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road , north of the central business district , in 1996 . The name was also changed to Atlantic Baptist University , a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation . ABU sports teams play under the name Blue Tide . ABU remains the only English university in New Brunswick 's second largest , and fastest growing city .
