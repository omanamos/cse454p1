ABTI - American University of Nigeria ( AAUN ) is the first American university ever to be established in Nigeria . With David Huwiler as its current president , it was commissioned by the Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar , and founded in partnership with the American University in Washington , D.C . Because of the lack of world class universities within the country , Vice President Atiku initiated discussions with the American University faculty in 2003 about building an American - style university in Yola , the capital of his home state of Adamawa State , Nigeria . He also built a primary and secondary school in 1992 and 2001 respectively with the name ABTI and they are located just opposite of the university . Those discussions led the ABTI - American University of Nigeria to sign a five - year management consultancy agreement with AU on January 1 , 2004 . Abubakar , whose wife Jennifer recently completed her PhD at AUâ€™s School of International Service ( SIS ) , is the leading funder for this effort .
