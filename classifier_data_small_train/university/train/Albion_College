The origin of Albion College lies not in the city of Albion , but about 10 miles southeast of the present location of the college . On March 23 , 1835 , Methodist Episcopal settlers in Spring Arbor Township obtained a charter for the Spring Arbor Seminary from the Michigan Territorial Legislature . Foundations for a building were begun in 1837 at a location about 3 miles southwest of the current village of Spring Arbor but were soon abandoned due to the economic turmoil caused by the Panic of 1837 . No classes were ever held at the Spring Arbor location . The trustees applied to move the seminary to Albion in 1838 , and the legislature approved the move in 1839 . With 60 acres ( 243,000 mÂ² ) of land donated by Albion pioneer , Jesse Crowell , the cornerstone was laid for the first building in 1841 . In 1843 , now named the Wesleyan Seminary , classes were first held in the local Methodist Church . In 1844 , classes began in the newly constructed Central Building , which was rebuilt as the present Robinson Hall in 1907 . The Albion Female Collegiate Institute was founded in 1850 by the Wesleyan Seminary Corporation . The two schools merged in 1857 under the name The Wesleyan Seminary and Female College at Albion .
