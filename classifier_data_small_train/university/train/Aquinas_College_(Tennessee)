Aquinas College is a Roman Catholic institution of higher learning located in Nashville , Tennessee , named in honor of Saint Thomas Aquinas . Aquinas College was founded by the Dominican Order in 1928 as St. Cecilia Normal School , and was first a school for nuns located at the St. Celcilia Motherhouse . In 1961 , the school moved away from the motherhouse , opened to the public , and became Aquinas Junior College . Aquinas College currently offers four year programs as well , notably in nursing and business . It is part of the Dominican Campus , located approximately five miles ( 8 km ) west of downtown Nashville . Also on the same plot of land are Overbrook School , an eight - grade Catholic primary school , and Saint Cecilia Academy , a Catholic girls ' high school . The addition of a third and fourth year collegiate curriculum caused a major change in the school 's operation . It had previously been a major power in junior college athletics ( notably baseball and basketball ) . However , the school 's administration felt that continuing to play junior college athletics while operating as a four - year college , as was done for a period , misrepresented the school 's true nature to the public and that competition at the four - year collegiate level of athletics would prove cost - prohibitive , so the institution currently sponsors no athletic programs .
