It was inaugurated officially by King Hassan II on 16 January 1995 . AUI is dedicated to being an international university . The university offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs . Significant research by faculty and students complements the University academic instruction . International students make up 25 - 30 % of its student body . All courses are taught in English . However , it gives special attention to the teaching of Arabic at all levels and in all branches of education . The architecture of the campus complements the distinctive building style of Ifrane , characteristic of mountain chalets with their high - pitched tile roofs and wooden beams . The steep roofs are designed to move the large quantities of wet heavy snow each winter . The campus , of approximately 0.5 square kilometres of rolling wooded terrain , consists of large chalets grouped around pleasant squares . AUI has many academic and institutional partnerships . In 1999 , Bell Laboratories , the research and development arm of Lucent Technologies and Al Akhawayn University signed a Collaborative Research Agreement whereby both parties will work together on joint telecommunications related research and development projects .
