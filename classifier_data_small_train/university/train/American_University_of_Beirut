The American University of Beirut ( AUB ; Arabic : الجامعة الأميركية في بيروت‎ ) is a private , independent , non - sectarian university in Beirut , Lebanon . It was founded as the Syrian Protestant College by American missionaries ( namely Dr. Daniel Bliss ) in 1866 . The name was changed to American University of Beirut on November 18 , 1920 . The current President of the university is Dr. John Waterbury . Its Provost is Dr. Peter Heath . At the end of July 2002 , the number of degrees and diplomas awarded since June 1870 totaled 66,107 . In 1862 , American missionaries in Syria , under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , asked Dr. Daniel Bliss to withdraw from the evangelistic work and missions in Syria ( Lebanon was South Western Syria , Lebanon was created in August 1920 by the Colonial French ) to find a college of higher learning that would include medical training with an American educational character , administered independently from the Mission , and self - maintained . Dr. Bliss travelled to the United States , in the summer of 1862 , to solicit funds for this new enterprise . By August 1864 , he had raised $100,000 . However , because of inflation during the Civil War , he raised a sterling fund in England to start the operations of the college , leaving the dollar fund to appreciate . After collecting 4,000 in England , he travelled to Beirut in March 1866 . On April 24 1863 , while Dr. Bliss was raising money for the new school , the State of New York granted a charter under the name of the Syrian Protestant College . The college opened with its first class of 16 students on December 3 , 1866 . The cornerstone of College Hall , the first building on the present campus in Ras Beirut , was laid on December 7 , 1871 , by the Honorable William E. Dodge , Sr. , then Treasurer of the Board of Trustees . This college is for all conditions and classes of men without regard to color , nationality , race or religion . A man , white , black , or yellow , Christian , Jew , Muslim or heathen , may enter and enjoy all the advantages of this institution for three , four or eight years ; and go out believing in one God , in many gods , or in no God . But it will be impossible for anyone to continue with us long without knowing what we believe to be the truth and our reasons for that belief . College Hall and the first medical building were completed and put to use in 1873 , and the bell in the tower of College Hall pealed for the first time in March , 1874 . However , College Hall was extensively damaged by an explosion in the early morning of November 8 , 1991 , and the building had to be demolished . It was later rebuilt , and the new College Hall was inaugurated in the spring of 1999 . Since the earliest years , the University has continually expanded and developed new faculties and programs . In 1867 , the University started the School of Medicine . Four years later , in 1871 , both school of pharmacy and a preparatory school were added . The latter became independent in 1960 and is currently known as International College . In 1900 , the University established a
