AGH University of Science and Technology ( Polish Akademia Górniczo - Hutnicza im. Stanisława Staszica ) is the second largest technical university in Poland , located in Kraków . The university was established in 1919 , and was formerly known as the University of Mining and Metallurgy . It has 15 faculties and two schools , which will become new faculties in the near future . At the conference of the Polish miners and metallurgists held in Kraków on 24 February 1912 , a resolution was passed indicating the need for the university of mining . A campaign of support was started in the Parliament of Austria - Hungary . On 10 July 1912 , the Ministry of Public Works agreed to the founding of the Academy . In April 1913 the Organizing Committee was appointed and on 31 May 1913 , the Academy of Mining was established . The building site was chosen and the competition for the architectural designs announced . The Academy opened on 1 October 1919 , under the auspices of the already sovereign Polish Second Republic . The Head of State , Józef Piłsudski , inaugurated the Academy in the hall of Collegium Novum of the Jagiellonian University with its first 80 students beginning their education at the newly formed Faculty . The Faculty of Metallurgy was added in 1922 . In 1939 the Academy had approximately 600 students and 30 professors . In the twenty - year period of Interbellum between 1919 and 1939 , a total of 797 mining and metallurgy engineers graduated from the Academy , and about 100 foreign diplomas were officially recognized . The graduates took over senior posts in the Polish industry , particularly in Upper Silesia and other industrial centres . At the onset of World War II , during Operation Sonderaktion Krakau 132 professors and assistant professors were arrested by the Nazis in the building of Collegium Novum . 21 academicians were sent to a concentration camp at Sachsenhausen . The main building was confiscated by the German General Government . Part of the Academy however , retained its status and became the centre for underground teaching , vital for the Academy 's future . After the war , a group of professors , staff members and students reclaimed the ruined main building of the Academy . In the same year more than 500 students began their courses . It was vital for the country to train professors who would replace those who perished . In 1946 new faculties were opened : the Faculty of Geology and Surveying , and the Faculty of Ceramics , broadening the Academy 's programme . In 1949 the Academy was renamed as the Academy ( later University ) of Mining and Metallurgy . Under Stalinism and until 1956 the Academy enjoyed certain freedoms with its authorities still elected . Afterwards , the autonomy and elections were suspended for more than 10 years . Following the 1968 Polish political crisis the university was given the name of Stanisław Staszic University of Mining and Metallurgy . In the changing political aura the University improved its facilities . During the 30 - year period , from 1950 to 1979 , the number of students went up from 2,000 to 13,000 . During the 80 - year period ( except for the war years ) , 73,085 students graduated from the University with master 's or bachelor 's degrees . 3,607 persons were granted the degree of Doctor of Science , 896 successfully completed postdoctoral qualifications of Habilitated Doctor .
