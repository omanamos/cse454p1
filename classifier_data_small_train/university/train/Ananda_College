Ananda College , established November 1 , 1886 by the Buddhist Theosophical Society , is one of Sri Lanka 's oldest schools . Originally it was known as English Buddhist School , describing its stated intention of providing English instruction to Buddhist students who would otherwise have had to go to a missionary school in order to get an English education . The school opened on a modest scale with 37 students in a private house in Pettah . It was later relocated to Maradana and was named after Arahant Ananda , the most devoted disciple of the Buddha . Over the years , Ananda has produced notable alumni and thus contributed immensely to Sri Lanka . These include statesman such as the current Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake and former United National Party deputy leader Karu Jayasuriya , and famous cricketers Arjuna Ranatunga and Marvan Atapattu .
