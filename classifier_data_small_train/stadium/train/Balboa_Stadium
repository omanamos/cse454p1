Balboa Stadium is located in San Diego , California and was built in 1914 as part of the many buildings erected for the 1915 Panama - California Exposition located in Balboa Park . Originally called City Stadium , it is located behind San Diego High School and was the home of the American Football League 's San Diego Chargers ' from 1961 - 66 . The stadium originally had a seating capacity of aproximately 34,000 . Balboa Stadium witnessed the Chargers ' glory years , which featured such players as John Hadl , Lance Alworth and Ernie Ladd , and hosted the 1961 , 1963 , and 1965 American Football League championship games , as well as the 1961 , 1962 , and 1963 AFL All - Star games . In their six seasons here , head coach Sid Gillman 's club finished with a combined record of 28 - 12 - 2 , winning four Western Division titles and one league crown . In 1967 , the team left Balboa for new San Diego Stadium ( now Qualcomm Stadium ) in Mission Valley , where the club 's glory slowed and the titles stopped ( although they did win several American Football Conference Western Division titles ) until they won the AFC championship after the 1994 season . The stadium also hosted local amateur and professional baseball contests in the period prior to the establishment of the Pacific Coast League Padres in 1936 . On September 19 , 1919 , President Woodrow Wilson spoke in front of over 50,000 people in Balboa Stadium in support of the creation of the League of Nations . This was the first presidential speech to use an electronic voice amplification system . This system was invented by Edwin S. Pridham and Peter L. Jensen .

The NCAA football Harbor Bowl was held there from 1947 to 1949 . The San Diego East - West Christmas Classic was held here in 1921 and 1922 .
