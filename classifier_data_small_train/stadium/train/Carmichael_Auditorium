William D. Carmichael , Jr. Auditorium is a 8,010 - seat multi - purpose arena in Chapel Hill , North Carolina . The arena opened in 1965 . It is home to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels women 's basketball team . Before the Dean Smith Center opened in 1986 , it also housed the men 's team , which had a record of 169 - 20 ( .894 ) in just over 20 seasons there . It was named for William D. Carmichael , Jr. , a popular former school vice - president . The arena was built as an annex to Woollen Gymnasium , built in 1937 as the former home of the basketball team . It shares the older facility 's western wall . Carmichael was known as one of the loudest arenas in the country while the Tar Heel men played there , largely because of a low roof and a student section that ringed the court . According to some anectotal accounts , it was as loud or louder than Cameron Indoor Stadium . A new floor was installed in 1998 , after a roof fire that February during renovations .
