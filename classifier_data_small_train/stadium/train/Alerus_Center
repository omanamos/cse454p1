The Alerus Center is an indoor arena located in Grand Forks , North Dakota . It opened in 2001 . It is the home of the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux football team . The arena also plays host to many large concerts , sporting events , and trade shows . It can seat more than 21,000 people at one time . The facility includes an adjacent convention center which features twelve meeting rooms and a 28,000 square foot ( 2,600 m² ) ballroom . The convention center is used for conferences , seminars , banquets , parties , and smaller concerts . The Alerus Center is named after a local bank , Alerus Financial , which purchased the facility 's naming rights . The arena has had many big musical acts including Cher , The Backstreet Boys , * NSYNC , KISS , Aerosmith , Bette Midler , Cirque du Soleil , and Mötley Crüe . The 2002 Cher concert was the largest such event ever held at the arena and , at that time , was the largest audience the entertainer had ever performed in front of . Other non - music events have also been held at the Alerus Center including WWE Smackdown . Grand Forks is unique because it is a relatively small market with two major event centers that often bid on the same events : the Alerus Center and the Ralph Engelstad Arena . To a lesser extent , the Chester Fritz Auditorium in Grand Forks also sometimes competes for these same events as well . Located directly north of the Alerus Center sits the " Canad Inns Destination Center " , completed in 2007 . This $50 million dollar complex is anchored by a 13 - story hotel tower which , at 126 feet , is the tallest building in Grand Forks and the tallest building constructed in North Dakota since the mid 1980s . The " Destination Center " also includes the largest waterpark in the state , three restaurants , a " boutique " casino , and an arcade .
