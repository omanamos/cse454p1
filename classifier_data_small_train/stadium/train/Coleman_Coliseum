Coleman Coliseum is a 15,043 - seat multi - purpose arena in Tuscaloosa , Alabama . The arena opened in 1968 as a replacement for Foster Auditorium . It is home to the University of Alabama Crimson Tide basketball , gymnastics , and volleyball teams . In addition to sports , Coleman Coliseum is used for other events including concerts ( seating capacity 16,000 ) , commencement exercises , alumni gatherings , student convocations , operas , ballets and orations by political figures . President Ronald Reagan visited Coleman Coliseum during the mid - 1980s , the Coliseum has been used as an annual bass tournament weigh - in spot , and a Travis Tritt music video was filmed here . The stadium hosted the NCAA Basketball Tournament three times , as a regional site in 1974 and as a sub - regional in 1975 and 1981 . Coleman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman , a prominent alumnus . Until his death , in 1995 he was the only person that had attended every Alabama bowl game , starting with the Rose Bowl game on January 1 , 1926 . Jeff went on to serve the university in many capacities , from Business Manager of the football team to Director of Alumni Affairs , for almost 50 years . He was one of the first pledges at the Delta Chi Fraternity at Alabama and " AA " Emeritus for the National Fraternity . Before 1990 , the building was known as Memorial Coliseum . It is recognizable on television for its " striped " ceiling ( a result of bands of acoustical tiles ) and the two scoreboards behind each endline , both of which intersperse ads , video boards and scoring information with the familiar " R - O - L - L T - I - D - E " in large illuminated letters . The letters fomerly served as a noise meter during games , with the " E " in " TIDE " being red , as a sort of overload light . Now , all eight letters on both ends are constantly illuminated , and the final E is white , like the rest of the letters . The coliseum was renovated in 2005 .
