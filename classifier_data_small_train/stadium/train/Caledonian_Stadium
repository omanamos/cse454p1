The Caledonian Stadium , currently known as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium for sponsorship reasons is a football stadium situated in the Longman area of Inverness , Scotland . The stadium plays host to the home matches of Scottish Premier League team Inverness Caledonian Thistle . The club was formed in 1994 by the merging of two Highland Football Leaque clubs , Caledonian F.C. and Inverness Thistle F.C. Originally , Caley Thistle ( as Inverness Caledonian Thistle are also known ) played their home matches at Telford Street Park . However , one of the conditions of their acceptance into the Scottish Football League was that they would move to a newly - built ground in within their first few seasons . Constructions on the ground begun in 1995 and in November 1996 , the ground hosted its first SFL match : a 1 - 1 draw between Caley Thistle and Albion Rovers . When the club won the First Division in 2004 , they faced a problem in that the Caledonian Stadium did not meet the SPL 's rules on stadium criteria . As a result , the club groundshared with Aberdeen at Pittodrie for the first half of the 2004 - 05 season , while redevelopment works were carried out at the Caledonian Stadium . The redevelopment included the construction of two new stands at either end of the ground , which made the stadium all - seater and increased its capacity to over 7,500 . These stands were built in a remarkable 47 days by the Tulloch Construction Company who are also the club 's biggest shareholder . As Tulloch also paid part of the development cost , the stadium had the Tulloch name added to it on completion of the work .
