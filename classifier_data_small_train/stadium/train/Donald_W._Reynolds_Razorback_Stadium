Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium is the home of the Arkansas Razorbacks football team of the University of Arkansas , which is located in Fayetteville , Arkansas , USA . The current head coach of the football team is coach Houston Nutt . Razorback Stadium is nestled in the Ozarks . In the year 2001 , the stadium was expanded to its current 72,000 seat capacity from its previous capacity of 51,000 seats . Then , in the 2006 season , the stadium added top bleachers to make the size of the stadium 76,000 . In addition to the additional seating , several improvements were made . A new scoreboard was installed with the largest Smartvision LED screen ( often incorrectly referred to as a Jumbotron ; it is nicknamed the " PigScreen " ) incorporated into it . Also , luxury boxes , expanded food court , revitalized locker rooms , and the Bob and Marilyn Bogle Academic Center were all part of the improvements that were made . The Frank Broyles Athletics Center , home to the Razorback Athletic Department and named after Frank Broyles , is located at the north end of the Stadium ; the Center was built in 1975 and renovated in 1994 and also features the Jerry Jones / Jim Lindsey Hall of Champions , a museum to University of Arkansas sports . The stadium is not the only " home " of the Razorback football team . Some of the " home " games ( usually 2 or 3 each season ) are played in War Memorial Stadium which is located in Little Rock , Arkansas , approximately 190 miles ( 305 km ) ( by interstate ) from the University of Arkansas main campus in Fayetteville , Arkansas . After somewhat of a statewide controversy ( some people wanted all the games played in Donald W. Reynolds Razorback stadium , while some people wanted games to continue being split with War Memorial Stadium ) , in 2001 an agreement was signed with War Memorial Stadium to allow " home " games to be played at War Memorial for the next 15 seasons . Before 1938 , the Hogs ( another name for the Arkansas Razorbacks ) played in a 300 - seat stadium built in the year 1901 on land on top of " The Hill " which is now occupied by Mullins Library and the Fine Arts Center ( in the " center " of campus ) . When this stadium was first dedicated , it was called " University Stadium " which changed within weeks to " Bailey Stadium " after then Arkansas Governor Carl E. Bailey . The name was changed again in 1941 to Razorback Stadium . The Donald W. Reynolds Foundation made a major contribution to the 2001 stadium expansion , which was then honored by adding Reynolds ' name to the stadium .
