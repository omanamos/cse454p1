It has extensive stable and barn facilities for animal events , which are used for the annual Grand National Rodeo and occasionally for other events . The idea for the arena was originally conceived as the result of the popularity of the livestock pavilion at the 1915 Pan - Pacific Exposition . It was another decade before steps were taken to finance the building , and legislative delays and the onset of the Great Depression meant that the building was not completed until 1941 . Thus , the Cow Palace was born . Other sources say that an advertisement company actually coined the name the " Cow Palace " after a man named Willard S. Anderson who said , at the time of the building 's construction , that " they are just building a palace for cows. " . The arena opened in April , 1941 . During World War II , though , the arena was used for processing soldiers bound for the Pacific Theater .
