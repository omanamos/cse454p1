The Alexander Memorial Coliseum ( also nicknamed The Thrillerdome ) is an indoor arena located in Atlanta , Georgia . It is the home of the basketball teams of Georgia Tech and hosted the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA from 1968–1972 and again from 1997–1999 . Tech 's women 's volleyball team occasionally uses the facility as well , primarily for NCAA tournament games and other matches that draw crowds that would overflow the O'Keefe Gymnasium . The 270 - foot diameter Alexander Coliseum was originally opened in 1956 at the northeast end of the Georgia Tech campus . It served as a replacement for the Heisman Gymnasium on the campus of Georgia Tech , an 1,800 seat arena opened just eighteen years before . It has undergone three major renovations . In 1986 , 2150 seats were added in what was previously an upper walkway around the rim of the arena . In 1989–1990 , 750 seats were added in the endzone areas . The last major renovation was during 1995–1996 , prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics . The floor was lowered four feet to increase seating , twelve luxury suites were added , and many of the benches were replaced with chairback seats . Sightlines were also improved for those sitting in the first few rows of the side of the court opposite the benches . Connected to the south end of the Coliseum are the Luck Building , constructed in the 1980s , and the Coliseum Annex , which was constructed slightly before the Coliseum itself . The Coliseum Annex houses locker rooms , a practice gym , and the offices of Georgia Tech Facilities . The top floor of the Coliseum Annex housed the studios of radio station WGST prior to 1975 and the student radio station , WREK , from 1978 to 2004 . Like most competitive teams , Tech squads have been extremely successful on their home court , but winning only explains part of the affection and loyalty that Tech fans feel for Alexander . Fans enter the building onto a concourse with arena entrances that are near the top row of the seats ( it was the top prior to the 1986 addition of 10 rows ) and are greeted by a gleaming court below them and an enormous open space under the arches that soar several hundred feet above the floor . The result is a spectating experience that feels intimate and raucous in a setting that is spacious and grand . Many buildings offer unobstructed views of the court , but few have such a high percentage of the seats so close to the action . Those fortunate enough to sit right behind either goal can often hear conversations between players and coaches , at least when the noise levels aren’t deafening . The building was named for William A. Alexander in 1956 . Alexander was the Tech football coach from 1920 - 1944 and the third athletic director ( after John W. Heisman ) ; his tenure as coach included the 1928 Rose Bowl team . The facility was known as the Alexander Memorial Coliseum at McDonald 's Center for 10 seasons from 1996 to 2005 in conjunction with a $5.5 million donation to help pay for the mid - 1990s renovation . Today , the arena seats 9,191 . A McDonald 's restaurant was added during the last renovation but has since closed . The " golden arches " on the signs remain pursuant to their corporate donation . During the 1996 Summer Olympics , the arena
