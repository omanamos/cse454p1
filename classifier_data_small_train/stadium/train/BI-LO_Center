The BI - LO Center is an arena located in downtown Greenville , South Carolina that is used for hockey games , basketball games and concerts . The BI - LO Center was built in 1998 at a cost of US$63 million to replace Greenville 's outdated and under - repaired Greenville Memorial Auditorium . The arena was named for BI - LO , a regional grocery store chain headquartered in the Greenville area that paid for the arena 's naming rights . When it was built , the BI - LO Center was the largest arena in the state of South Carolina , a distinction it held until 2002 , when the Colonial Center was built in Columbia , South Carolina . As a concert venue , the BI - LO Center can seat between 11,000 and 15,951 spectators , depending on the positioning of the stage . The arena features 30 luxury suites and 840 club seats . The arena floor measures 113 feet wide by 229 feet long . There are 7,472 seats in the upper bowl and 4,809 permanent seats and 1,290 retractable seats in the lower bowl . The BI - LO Center hosted first and second round games during the 2002 NCAA Men 's Basketball Tournament . However , the NCAA has since implemented a policy to not hold tournament games in either South Carolina or Mississippi , following a recommendation from the NAACP . As a result , the BI - LO Center has not hosted an NCAA Tournament game since 2002 . College basketball made its return to Greenville in 2005 , when the SEC Women 's Basketball Tournament was played at the BI - LO Center , in an emergency situation which turned out to be worthless . The Philips Arena in Atlanta was the scheduled site for the tournament , but backed out in the summer of 2004 because of logistics following plans for the 54th NHL All - Star Game which was to be held just six weeks before the 2005 SEC Women 's Basketball Tournament . Because of the 2004 - 05 NHL Lockout , the plans were aborted , but not after the SEC had moved the women 's tournament 140 miles east . The arena has also served as the home for the Greenville Groove ( 2001 - 2003 ) , one of the original members of the NBA Development League , as well as the Carolina Rhinos football team ( 2000 - 2002 ) , one of the inaugural members of af2 , the Arena Football League 's minor league , as well as the Greenville Grrrowl of the ECHL ( 1998 - 2006 ) . Aside from mainstream league sports , the BI - LO Center also regularly hosts a wide variety of events such as Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus , professional wrestling , monster truck rallies , motocross racing , professional ice skating , such as the Champions on Ice , and ice dancing shows and competitions , dog shows , and concerts spanning many different musical genres . The only significant sporting events held at the arena is currently the South Carolina High School League Basketball Upper State Finals .
