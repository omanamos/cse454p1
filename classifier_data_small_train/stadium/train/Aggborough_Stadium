Aggborough Stadium is the ground of Kidderminster Harriers FC . The club website describes it as " a compact but smart ground that has undergone major building work over the past fifteen years " . It has a capacity of approximately 6,238 , of which 3,140 can be seated . The record attendance at the ground is 9,155 , when the Harriers entertained Hereford United in the FA Cup in 1948 . The ground was the first in the country to host a floodlit FA Cup match , when on September 14 1955 Harriers played Brierley Hill Alliance in a preliminary round replay , which Harriers won 4 - 2 . Goals by stars such as Paul ' Ocker ' Davies , Kim Casey , the Wassall brothers , Lee Hughes , Bo Henriksen and Ian Foster have won many memorable matches at Aggborough over the years . No - one present at the time will forget John Williams giving Kidderminster the lead in an FA Cup tie at the stadium vs Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2004 , though they went on to lose to the Premiership opposition in the replay . When Kidderminster won their first Conference title in 1994 , Aggborough was not deemed to be up to Football League standards and as a result Kidderminster did not achieve promotion to Division Three . The club 's officials vowed that the sub - standard wooden stand was about to be replaced , but these promises fell upon deaf ears . By the time Kidderminster won their second Conference title six years later , the ground had been upgraded to Football League standards and promotion was awarded , though they were relegated back to the Conference after five years .
