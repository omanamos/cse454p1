Cox Arena , located on the San Diego State University ( SDSU ) campus in San Diego , California , USA , is the home of the SDSU Aztecs men 's and women 's basketball teams . Built in 1997 , it seats 12,414 for basketball and up to 12,845 for concerts . Cox Arena also hosts SDSU 's commencement ceremonies . Previously , the Aztecs played at Peterson Gym and , later , San Diego Sports Arena . Cox Arena was built on the site of the old Aztec Bowl football stadium ( a Works Progress Administration project ) on the SDSU campus , and the university ( or its affiliated corporation ) still owns the arena . It was named for Cox Communications , which owns the local cable television system in the greater San Diego regional area , and which paid fees to become the arena 's corporate sponsor . The arena 's official name is Cox Arena at Aztec Bowl . Cox Arena hosted the men 's NCAA basketball tournament first and second rounds in 2001 and 2006 . In the 2006 tourney , the first - round games were delayed and the building evacuated due to a bomb - sniffing dog picking up scents of a potentially dangerous substance . These fears were unfounded , however , and play went on as scheduled . Cox Arena has also hosted WCW Bash at the Beach in 1998 . In 2007 will be the home of the expansion San Diego Shockwave indoor football team .
