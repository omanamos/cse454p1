It is the home ground of the Newcastle Knights ( NRL ) and Newcastle United Jets ( A - League ) teams . It is owned and managed by the Hunter International Sports Centre Trust . Work began on the stadium on December 1 , 1967 , and was officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the April 10 , 1970 .

The Knights secured a lease on the stadium in 1986 , and converted it from an oval to a rectangle layout . In the early 1990s , local tyre outlet Marathon Tyres became the naming rights sponsor for the stadium , and it was renamed Marathon Stadium . Towards the end of 2001 , energy supplier EnergyAustralia took over naming rights , and thus the stadium became EnergyAustralia Stadium .

The ground attendance record is 32,642 , which was set when the Knights took on the Manly - Warringah Sea Eagles in July 1995 . Despite a lack of incidents , police subsequently asked for the allowed capacity to be lowered for reasons of safety . Following the retirement of former Knights captain Andrew Johns , the new eastern grandstand was renamed The Andrew Johns Stand in front of a packed crowd before the Knights vs Brisbane Broncos NRL match on Sunday 22 April 2007 . The stadium underwent redevelopment during the years 2003 - 2005 , funded mostly by local and state government grants . The first stage of the redevelopment was completed in early 2004 .
