The Commerzbank - Arena ( also historically known as Waldstadion ) is a 52,300 seat stadium in Frankfurt , Germany , that is primarily used for football and American football . It is the home of the Eintracht Frankfurt and Frankfurt Galaxy . This stadium will also be the sight of World Bowl XV , the championship game of NFL Europa . The Waldstadion was first opened in 1925 and during World War II it was also used for political events . It has been named " Commerzbank - Arena " since July 2005 . During the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the stadium was called " FIFA WM Stadion Frankfurt " ( in English , " FIFA World Cup Stadium Frankfurt " ) . Large modifications were made for the tournament with the stadium being nearly completely rebuilt and modernized . Now it is one of Germany 's biggest stadiums and there have already been some important events in last year , such as the finale of the Confederations Cup . One modification involved suspending a large four - sided structure over the stadium with large screens on each side for the crowds to see . On sunny days this creates a large shadow on the pitch , making it more difficult to watch matches via television because the cameras have to adjust between the light dark areas of the pitch . During the Korea Republic vs Togo match the roof was closed over the stadium , despite the weather being dry and sunny , presumably to shade the whole pitch and avoid the effects of the shadow . This decision was criticised by some because it meant the stadium became very hot and humid on an already hot and humid day . The stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup . However , due to sponsorship contracts , the stadium was called FIFA World Cup Stadium Frankfurt during the World Cup .
