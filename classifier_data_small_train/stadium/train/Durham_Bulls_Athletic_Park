Durham Bulls Athletic Park is a baseball park in Durham , North Carolina that is home to the Durham Bulls , the AAA affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays of Major League Baseball . The 10,000 - seat park was opened in 1995 , when the Bulls were still a Class A team in the Carolina League ( they would not become a Class AAA team until 1998 ) . Designed by HOK Sport + Venue + Event , who also designed Camden Yards in Baltimore , Jacobs Field in Cleveland , and Coors Field in Colorado as part of the " new " old - stadium - like movement of the 1990s . By design , the left field fence is a 32 - foot - high wall 305 feet from home plate , known as the Blue Monster . It resembles Fenway Parkâ€™s Green Monster , including a manual scoreboard . The bull sign that sits on top of the Blue Monster was modeled after the bull used in the 1988 film , Bull Durham . The actual sign from the movie ( which featured the previous home of the Bulls , Durham Athletic Park ) is hung in the concourse level of the DBAP . Although much sturdier than the original , the new sign 's limitations were revealed in violent winds that rocked the Piedmont on May 16 , 2007 - the bull 's head and forelegs were torn off by the storm . The photo shown here was taken five days before the storm .
