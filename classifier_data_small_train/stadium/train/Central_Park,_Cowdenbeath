Originally the team played at another ground called North End Park . They moved to Central Park when it was opened in 1917 . The ground is situated in the centre of the town , beside the High Street . Central Park has a capacity of 4,370 . The most unusual feature of the ground is a tarmac race - track circling the pitch . The track means fans on the east and west terraces are quite far away from the pitch . The pitch size is 107 x 66 yards . Three sides of the ground are uncovered standing terraces . The seating area is on the north side of the stadium , which seats 1,431 spectators . Another unusual feature is that there are actually two stands here , side by side . Originally there was one main grandstand here which sat 3,500 , however half of it was destroyed by a fire in 1992 . The surviving section of this stand is called the West Stand , or the Old Stand . Beside this the ' Alex Menzies Stand ' ( or New Stand ) was constructed in 1993 . Along with this the club built new dressing rooms , a board room , function suite , and office facilities . Both stands have a row of floodlight pylons in front of them , which can obstruct supporters views . As the perimeter wall surrounding the ground is very low it is possible to watch games from outside the stadium , without paying to enter . There are currently plans for Cowdenbeath to move to a new stadium which will be located on the outskirts of Cowdenbeath . If plans go ahead the state of the art stadium should open in Summer 2009 . It is to be used 7 days a week for either Training or Games . It will cost around Â£4 million and it is unknown in Stockcars will also be allowed to race within the new stadium .
