The Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a 14,870 - seat multi - purpose indoor arena in Phoenix , Arizona , located on the grounds of the Arizona State Fair . It is commonly referred to as simply the Coliseum . Newspaper reports state that The Arizona State Fair Commission began planning for an " Arizona State Fairgrounds Exposition Center " as early as the fall of 1962 . The Commission envisioned an indoor facility which could be used during the State Fair as well as year - round . In 1964 , Phoenix architect Leslie Mahoney presented the commission with the final plans , and construction began that summer . The unique saddle - shaped , cable - suspension roof , supporting over 1000 precast concrete panels , was considered innovative architectural engineering at the time . In April 1965 , the name was officially changed to honor Arizona 's war veterans . There was an early controversy over whether alcohol would be served at the new facility , but legislation was signed in April 1965 by Governor Sam Goddard providing for limited liquor sales . The Coliseum opened November 3 , 1965 , with a production of Ice Follies . The final cost was estimated at $7 million . This distinctive arena with its saddle - shaped roof , which sat 13,730 for ice hockey , was the home of the Phoenix Roadrunners of the WHA from 1974–1977 and of the now - defunct International Hockey League from 1989 to 1996 , the Phoenix Suns of the NBA from 1968–1992 , the Arizona Thunder of the World Indoor Soccer League from 1998 - 2000 , and the Phoenix Mustangs of the now - defunct WCHL from 1999 - 2000 . In 2006 , it was announced that the Coliseum would once again be home to pro sports , as the IBL 's Phoenix Flame would play home games there . The Coliseum was affectionately referred to as " The Mad House on McDowell ( named for McDowell Road , the street in Phoenix where it is located ) during the Suns tenure there ; by both fans and the local media . It hosted the 1975 NBA All - Star Game and WCW Wrestle War 1991 . The Coliseum was also host to the Phoenix Mustangs hockey team as part of the West Coast Hockey League and the Phoenix Eclipse ABA basketball team . The ABA will return to the Coliseum , as the Phoenix Phantoms have selected that arena as one of their three venues . The arena remains open for some events , even though the Suns left in 1992 for the America West Arena ( now US Airways Center ) . The Arizona State Fair schedules concerts , comedy shows and other events in the Coliseum during the Fair 's annual season ( which begins each October ) . Until recently it hosted portions of Arizona 's high school basketball championships , but those have been moved to the newer Glendale Arena . In the fall of 2005 , the Coliseum sheltered up to 2,500 evacuees from New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . The evacuees were relocated to other housing in time for the opening of the Fair that October . It also hosts the West 's biggest book sale , during February .
