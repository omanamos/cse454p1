1st Mariner Arena in Baltimore , Maryland USA was formerly known as the Baltimore Arena and as the Baltimore Civic Center . In 2003 , it was renamed by 1st Mariner Bank , which purchased naming rights to the arena for 10 years . It was reported that 1st Mariner Bank will need to pay the city $75,000 for the next ten years to keep the naming rights to the Baltimore Arena . 1st Mariner Bank Arena is located about a block away from the Baltimore Convention Center on the corner of Baltimore Street and Hopkins Place ; it is also only a short distance from the Inner Harbor . It seats up to approximately 13,000 people though this number varies depending on the type of event . The Arena officially opened in 1962 as the Baltimore Civic Center . As a major cornerstone for the Inner Harbor redevelopment during the 1980s , it was reopened after renovations and was renamed the Baltimore Arena in 1986 . The arena itself is 40 years old as of 2003 and is owned by the city and managed by SMG , a private management company . Annually , the 1st Mariner Bank Arena is host to 800,000 people . A cornerstone to the arena was laid in the arena in 1961 with a vault that included messages from then - U.S. President John F. Kennedy , then - Maryland governor J. Millard Tawes , and then - Baltimore Mayor J. Harold Grady , the vault is expected to be opened in 2006 . On October 16th , 2004 , The Baltimore Sun revealed that an official step has started into replacing the 42 - year - old 1st Mariner Arena . The Maryland Stadium Authority recently started solicting proposals for a feasibility study on building an arena in downtown Baltimore , the request for proposals are due on November 1st , 2004 . According to the request for proposals that was released , the new arena would be built in the same site of 1st Mariner Arena and " would have a smaller seating capacity than would be required for an NHL or NBA team " but it does n't specify a specific seating capacity . On May 15th , 2007 , The Baltimore Sun reported that the feasibility study that was started in 2004 has been released publicly and it states that the current arena has " served its useful life " and that Baltimore must build a new arena or face the risk of losing events . A proposal to repair the arena 's aging systems was rejected , citing a estimated cost of $60 million and the study suggests the city to demolish 1st Mariner Arena and build a new arena on the same site or elsewhere in Baltimore . The proposed new arena would only seat 15,000 - 16,000 people , the study assumes that Baltimore will never be successful in attracting a NHL or NBA team in the future , either of which would require a minimum of 18,000 - 20,000 seats . The new arena could be successful in attracting an arena football and a minor league hockey teams , bring more than 200 new jobs and generate up to $1 million in additional tax revenue . City officials are saying that the private sector would need to bear the brunt of the estimated $162 million construction cost of the new arena , the city is also considering giving up ownership of the arena . The Baltimore Development Corp. will , in the next month or so
