Clyde Williams Stadium was an outdoor stadium on the campus of Iowa State University at Ames , Iowa . It was the home of the football and track and field teams . It was originally built in 1914 - 15 , just south of the recently completed State Gym . It originally held 5,000 spectators , but expansions in 1925 , 1930 , 1932 , 1961 and 1966 brought the final capacity up to approximately 35,000 . It was the home of the Cyclones football team from its inception until 1975 , when Jack Trice Stadium opened in the newly built ISU Center south campus complex . Williams Stadium was razed in 1978 , and the site is now occupied by Martin and Eaton Halls , two residence halls constructed in 2002 and 2004 , respectively . The stadium was named for Clyde Williams , alumnus , coach and athletic director at the school in the early 20th century .
