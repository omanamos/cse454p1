The arena has been noted for its loud character and continual at - capacity crowds , which , combined with wood floors , make it a tough environment for visiting teams . It is considered the loudest NBA arena . The arena has hosted the NCAA Tournament four times as a first and second rounds venue in 1994 , 1998 , 2002 , and 2007 . In 1993 and 1994 , the arena also hosted several NHL exhibition and neutral site games . It played host to the Ultimate Fighting Championship 's UFC 65 on November 18 2006 .

On March 19 , 2007 , the Maloof brothers announced a multi - year agreement extension of the naming rights of ARCO Arena . A partially built baseball stadium is located on the northern end of the arena . Financing for the stadium fell through , and eventually was abandoned . The construction of Raley Field dashed hopes of finishing the project , however there have been talks of converting this location to a soccer stadium .
