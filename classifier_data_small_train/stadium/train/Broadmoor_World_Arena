The Broadmoor World Arena was a pioneering skating rink and hockey arena located at the Broadmoor Resort & Spa in Colorado Springs , Colorado . Originally an outdoor riding academy , the building was enclosed and converted to an ice arena which opened in January of 1938 . It was the original home of the Colorado College Tigers hockey team , as well as the Broadmoor Skating Club , a major force in the figure skating community . The building served as the first home of the NCAA Hockey Championships , which it hosted for the first ten years of its existence ( 1948 - 1957 ) and once more , in 1969 . It also hosted the World Figure Skating Championships five times between 1957 and 1975 . In 1993 , the Broadmoor announced that it would be closing the venerable arena to make room for a $27 million expansion of the resort . It closed in March of 1994 . The last major event held at the arena was the 1994 World Junior Figure Skating Championships . There is a memorial on the grounds of the hotel to the members of the 1961 US Figure Skating team , all of whom perished in the crash of their flight to the 1961 championships near Brussells , Belgium .
