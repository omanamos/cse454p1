The show marked the first of nine in Japan during the tour and highlighted the official opening of the Marine stadium . Unfortunately for Madonna , the dates coincided with Japan 's rainy season , and the show was dramatically scaled - back to accomodate driving rain and high winds . Some clips and dialogue of the opening night performances - including of the stage being swept of rainwater by Madonna 's road crew , and her performing in a jacket and ski - pants instead of the intended costumes - can be seen in the 1991 tour documentary , " Truth or Dare " . According to some sources , the Chiba Marine Stadium was the " Stadium " fighting level in Tekken from 1994 / 1995 .
