The College Avenue Gymnasium is an athletic facility on the campus of Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey . It is the second gymnasium built on the site . The first was built in 1892 on the site of College Field , the former RU football field . The first collegiate game of American football was played on the site on November 6 , 1869 , with Rutgers beating Princeton University , 6 goals to 4 ( roughly 42 - 28 under today 's scoring ) . The old gym burned down in 1930 , and the replacement went up in 1931 . Officially , it is the College Avenue Gymnasium , but it is known to the RU community as " The Barn. " . Most of the seating is in the form of a balcony , upstairs from the court level , giving the gym one of the most intimate settings in Eastern college basketball while it was RU 's main venue for the sport . Seating capacity has been approximately 3,200 throughout its existence . Rutgers reached its only NCAA Final Four in the 1975 - 76 season , going undefeated until losing to the University of Michigan in the National Semifinal . Home games at The Barn became festive affairs , with the crowd yelling so loudly that paint chips fell from the ceiling . RU knew it was time to build a bigger home court , and the Rutgers Athletic Center was built across the Raritan River in Piscataway in time for the 1977 - 78 season . It was renamed the Louis Brown Athletic Center in 1986 . The College Avenue Gym remains the home of RU 's wrestling and volleyball teams , and there are no plans to replace it . The current Constitution of the State of New Jersey was written and adopted in a convention held at the College Avenue Gym in 1947 .
