Dick 's Sporting Goods Park is a soccer - specific stadium located in Commerce City , Colorado , home to the Colorado Rapids professional soccer team . The park can seat up to 18,086 people , but may accommodate up to 26,000 for certain events and is built on over 360 acres ( 1.5 kmÂ² ) of land . Also included at the venue are youth soccer fields ( 24 fully - lit professional fields , two of which are year - round artificial grass fields ) , retail development , and a new Commerce City civic center . The stadium is owned by Commerce City and operated by Kroenke Sports Enterprises ( KSE ) who also own the Colorado Avalanche , Denver Nuggets , Colorado Crush and the Colorado Mammoth , and who is a co - owner of the English Premier League side Arsenal F.C. via subsidiary . The estimated cost of this project was $131 million , with investment shared equally between the city and KSE . The complex is close to Denver 's former Stapleton International Airport and is bordered on the north and east by the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge , to the south by 56th Avenue , and to the west by Quebec Street . It will host the 2007 MLS All - Star Game . The stadium 's awkward nomenclature and suggestive name have given rise to some degree of crude humor , and it has been popularly nicknamed " The Dick " .
