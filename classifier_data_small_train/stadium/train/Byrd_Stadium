Byrd Stadium is the home stadium of the University of Maryland Terrapins football team as well as the men 's lacrosse team . The facility is named after Harry C. Byrd , a multi - sport athlete , football coach , and university president in the first half of the 20th century . In August 2006 , naming rights were sold to Chevy Chase Bank , and the current name of the field is Chevy Chase Bank Field at Byrd Stadium . Byrd Stadium , constructed at a cost of $1 million , opened September 30 , 1950 . For four decades , Byrd Stadium consisted of a horseshoe - shaped bowl with capacity of 34,680 . In 1991 , the five - story Tyser Tower , featuring luxury suites and an expanded press area , was completed on the south side of the stadium , as well as the Gossett Football Team House adjacent to the east endzone . In 1995 , the stadium 's capacity was raised to 48,055 though the addition of an upper deck on the north side of the stadium . In November 2001 , as the football once again became an ACC - title contender , temporary bleachers were brought in for an additional 3,000 seats . Those bleachers remain to this day . In 2002 , a full - color video scoreboard was added in the east endzone and an expansion of the Gossett Football Team House was begun . The athletic department hopes to parlay the success of the Ralph Friedgen era into a stadium expansion that will increase capacity to 65,000 in the next several years . Byrd Stadium 's attendance record is 58,973 set November 1 , 1975 , in a game featuring the # 14 Terps and # 9 Penn State . The lone version of the Presidential Cup college football bowl game was held here in December of 1950 . The USFL Baltimore Stars called the stadium home in 1985 . It has hosted the Division I NCAA Men 's Lacrosse Championship ten times . On August 24 , 2006 , the Washington Post reported that the University of Maryland agreed to a $20 million naming - rights deal with Chevy Chase Bank in what 's being viewed as a key component to the proposed expansion of Byrd Stadium . The university 's football stadium is now known as Chevy Chase Bank Field at Byrd Stadium . Revenue from the deal will help pay for renovation and expansion of the stadium , which will include luxury suites and an increase in capacity . On April 25 , 2007 the Athletics Department unveiled plans for a $50.8 million expansion to Byrd Stadium , a project that will increase overall capacity , add skyboxes complete with catered food and flat panel televisions and lower the field to give spectators a better view . The first phase of the expansion plans will be renovating the current press tower and turning it into 64 luxury suites that will stretch from end zone to end zone . This project will be completed by the 2010 season at the latest and possibly by the 2009 season if various factors work out . Byrd will also be getting a second , state - of - the - art LED video board on the west side of the stadium in time for the 2007 season . Phase two of the project will be adding around 8,000 seats to the west end zone and taking total capacity over 60,000 . This will be paid for largely with
