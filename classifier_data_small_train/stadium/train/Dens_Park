Dens Park is a football stadium located on Dens Road in the Scottish city of Dundee . The stadium is the home of Dundee F.C. and has a capacity of 11,856 . Uniquely , the stadium shares ( see Google Maps ) part of the same road ( Sandeman Street ) as Tannadice Park , which is the home of city rivals Dundee United F.C . The club moved to ' Dens ' from their first stadium at Carolina Port in 1899 . Over the years , the ground has been redeveloped , with the construction of the near - identical Bobby Cox and Bob Shankly stands , which sit at either end of the ground . The former is given over to home supporters , and the latter to visiting supporters . In 2002 , plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in Dundee , as part of Scotland 's bid to host the 2008 European Football Championship . This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near - neighbours Dundee United . However , Scotland were not successful in their bid , which meant these plans were put on ice for the time being . They could be resurrected should Scotland launch a successful bid for future European Championships .
