Alltel Arena is an 18,000 - seat multi - purpose arena in North Little Rock , Arkansas , directly across the Arkansas River from downtown Little Rock . The arena opened in October 1999 . The University of Arkansas at Little Rock Trojans played home games at the arena from the time when the arena opened until the team moved in 2005 to a new stadium , the Jack Stephens Center , on the school 's campus in Little Rock . The Arkansas RiverBlades , a defunct ice hockey team of the ECHL , also played at the Alltel Arena . On August 1 , 1995 , Pulaski County , Arkansas , voters approved a one - year , one - cent sales tax for the purpose of building a multi - purpose arena , expanding the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock , and making renovations to the Main Street bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock . That money , combined with a $20 million contribution from the State of Arkansas , $17 million from private sources and $7 million from Little Rock - based Alltel Corporation paid for the construction of a 377,000 - square - foot arena , which cost nearly $80 million to build . When the doors opened in 1999 , the facility was paid for and there was no public indebtedness . Two sites in North Little Rock drew interest from county officials for the proposed arena . The first was a 19.5 - acre commercial site west of Interstate 30 , which contained a strip mall , a Kroger and an abandoned K - Mart storefront . The second site was an 11.6 acre plot at the foot of the Broadway Bridge . The Pulaski County Multipurpose Civic Center Facilities Board selected the larger site for the arena in 1996 and paid $3.7 million for the land , some of which was acquired through eminent domain , a move protested in court by several landowners . The second site later would be chosen for the new baseball stadium , Dickey - Stephens Park , constructed for the Arkansas Travelers . The Class AA minor - league baseball team moved from the then 73 - year - old Ray Winder Field in Little Rock to a new $28 million home in North Little Rock at the start of the 2007 season . The arena was the home of the 2003 and 2006 Southeastern Conference Women 's Basketball Tournament and the 2000 Sun Belt Conference menâ€™s basketball tournament . According to media reports , the SEC is interested in the arena hosting the women basketball tournament again in 2009 . The Arena holds the all - time attendance record for an SEC Women 's Tournament when 43,642 people attended the event in 2003 . The arena will host portions of the first and second rounds of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament in March of 2008 and the SEC Gymnastics Championships in 2007 . The arena hosted the Arkansas Awana Games in 2006 and WWE No Mercy in 2002 .
