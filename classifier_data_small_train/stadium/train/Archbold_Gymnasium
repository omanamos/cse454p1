Archbold Gymnasium is a gymnasium located on the campus of Syracuse University in Syracuse , New York . It was built in 1908 with money donated by John D. Archbold , a major benefactor of the university , who also funded the building of Archbold Stadium , just to the west of the gymnasium ( now the site of the Carrier Dome ) . It served as the home to the men 's basketball team until the building of the Manley Field House in 1962 , with the exception of the time from January , 1947 to 1949 . This was due to a large fire which gutted most of the building . The building was rebuilt from 1948 to 1949 , and a southern addition was made in 1952 , as well as a neighboring gymnasium ( Flanagan Gymnasium ) , which was built in 1989 . The building now houses the school 's ROTC programs , as well as the bursar , financial aid services , aerospace studies and undergraduate processing .
