Camp Randall Stadium is an outdoor stadium in Madison , Wisconsin . It is the current home of the Wisconsin Badgers football team , and is located on the west side of the University of Wisconsin - Madison campus . It currently seats 80,321 and is widely known as one of the premier American football venues in collegiate athletics . It is the oldest stadium and fourth largest in the Big Ten Conference . Originally , the stadium consisted of a horseshoe opening to the south , with a running track around the field . The stadium received its name because it lies on the grounds of Camp Randall , a former Union Army base during the American Civil War that was eventually absorbed by the Wisconsin campus . The camp was named after Governor Alexander Randall , who was also a United States Postmaster General . The field was originally natural grass , and was one of the first in the United States to convert to artificial turf , in 1968 . A new AstroTurf field was installed in 1990 . An artificial grass field , FieldTurf , was installed for the 2003 season . The stadium also houses athletic offices of the university . In 2002 , a large - scale reconstruction project commenced , in which luxury boxes , football program offices , and expanded seating that increased capacity . In addition , concessions , restrooms and other infrastructure items were upgraded , the walkway around the football field was removed , and new scoreboards were installed . The construction was completed prior to the start of the 2005 season . The football team continued to play at the stadium throughout the construction .

The crowd in the back , not fully aware of what was going on at the front , continued to move forward , now being aided by gravity . As a result , those up front got caught and were pressed against the rails , and then were trampled as the throng spilled onto the field . 73 students were injured , six of them critically .
