The Chicago Stadium was a famed and historic indoor arena in Chicago , Illinois . The arena was the site of numerous historic events , including the first NFL playoff game in 1932 ( moved inside and played on an 80 - yard field due to inclement weather ) , the 1932 , 1940 , and 1944 Democratic National Conventions , and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions , as well as numerous concerts , boxing matches and political rallies . It also hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929 - 1994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967 - 1994 . The venue was the site of the 1973 and 1988 NBA All - Star Games , and the 1948 , 1961 , 1974 and 1991 NHL All - Star Games . Also , in 1933 , the site hosted the funeral of Chicago mayor Anton J. Cermak . The stadium was first proposed by Chicago sports promoter Paddy Harmon . Harmon wanted to bring an NHL team to Chicago , but he lost out to another person . This team would soon be known as the Chicago Black Hawks ( later ' Blackhawks ' ) . Harmon then went on to at least try and get some control over the team by building a stadium for the Blackhawks to play in . He spent $2.5 million and borrowed more funds from friends in order to build the stadium . Completed on March 28 , 1929 at a cost of $9.5 million ( $2.5 million was funded by Harmon ) , Chicago Stadium was the largest indoor arena in the world at the time - the closest to it in terms of capacity at the time was the third incarnation of New York 's Madison Square Garden , which sat almost half as many people . It was also the first arena with an air conditioning system ( though the system was fairly rudimentary by modern standards , and was memorably given to filling the arena with fog during late - season games ) . The Stadium sat 17,317 for hockey at the time of closure . Standees were allowed for many years , and often the official attendance figures in the published game summaries were given in round numbers , such as 18,500 or 20,000 . In addition to the close - quartered , triple - tiered , boxy layout of the building , much of the loud , ringing noise of the fans could be attributed to the fabled 3,663 - pipe Barton organ that was played during hockey games there , earning it the moniker of " The Madhouse on Madison ( Street ) " . It also became traditional for Blackhawk fans to cheer loudly throughout the singing of the Star Spangled Banner , especially when sung by Chicago favorite Wayne Messmer . Denizens of the second balcony often added sparklers and flags to the occasion . The most memorable of these was the singing before the 1991 NHL All - Star Game . It was also the very last NHL - used facility to retain the use of an analog dial - type large four - sided clock for timekeeping in professional hockey games . That clock eventually was replaced by a four - sided scoreboard with a digital clock , and then by another , this one with a color electronic message board . The Stadium was also one of the last three NHL arenas ( the others being Boston Garden and the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium ) to
