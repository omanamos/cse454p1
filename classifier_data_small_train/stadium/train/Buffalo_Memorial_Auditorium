Buffalo Memorial Auditorium ( also known as The Aud ) is an indoor arena in downtown Buffalo , New York . It hosted the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL from 1970 - 1996 , the Buffalo Braves of the NBA from 1970 - 1978 , the Buffalo Stallions of the MISL , the Buffalo Stampede and the Buffalo Wings of RHI , the Buffalo Bandits of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League , the Buffalo Blizzard of NPSL and the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League from 1940 to 1970 . Construction on the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium began on November 30 , 1939 and a grand opening celebration was held on October 14 , 1940 . Built for $2,700,000 the Aud was a WPA project . The arena originally sat 12,280 for ice hockey , with an additional 2,000 - 3,000 sitting in the floor area for basketball and other events . In addition to sporting events the Aud also hosted concerts by major acts such as The Grateful Dead who performed there twice . Circuses , dog shows and political events all took place at the Aud . An $8.7 million renovation took place for the 1970 inauguration of the Sabres and Braves franchises . The roof of the old arena was removed , an upper " orange level " was added , and a new roof was built above it . This raised the total capacity of the arena to about 18,000 for basketball and 16,433 for hockey . The renovations preserved the arena for another two and a half decades , but the Sabres moved out after the 1995 - 96 season , moving across the street to the Marine Midland Arena ( now HSBC Arena ) . It was the last arena in which the ice sheet fell short of the league - mandated 200 ft . In the years since its closing , the building has remained closed to the public although Buffalo 's Studio Arena Theatre was at times allowed to use the large floor surface to paint backgrounds for its productions . During the 2001 - 02 season , Sabres officials and the city of Buffalo entered the building to relocate some items from the main concourse of the Aud to HSBC Arena , including a sign for the " Old Aud 's Pub " which was re - incarnated by popular demand . During a Versus television broadcast from HSBC Arena during the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs , the inside of the Aud was shown and the video showed that the seating bowl and arena floor have remained virtually untouched . Most notably , the advertisements that were on the boards during the final Sabres home game in 1996 were still present and the scoreboard hanging above center ice remained in the rafters . For the last few years plans were in the works to renovate the Aud and re - purpose it as a Bass Pro Shops store , however on March 29 , 2007 these plans were officially abandoned . Instead it was announced that Bass Pro will build a new building on the Buffalo waterfront near the old Aud . The Aud is now planned for demolition . Although there is no scheduled date for the demolition , it is expected to cost 10 million dollars .
