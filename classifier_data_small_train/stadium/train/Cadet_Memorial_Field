Cadet Memorial Field is an outdoor athletic facility on the campus of the United States Coast Guard Academy , on the banks of the Thames River in New London , Connecticut . The stadium hosts the Academy 's football and soccer teams , and , owing to the dramatic view of the river , is regarded as one of the most picturesque venues in New England small college football . The Academy competes in NCAA Division III . The stadium was originally named Jones Field , in honor of Cadet Henry L. Jones , the first Coast Guard cadet to die on active duty . The facility now honors all those who have died during their time as cadets . The stadium has hosted its share of prominent individuals , including NFL hall - of - famer Otto Graham , who prowled the sidelines as head coach of the football team for seven seasons , from 1959 to 1966 . During this time , the stadium hosted one undefeated squad in 1963 , which represented the only undefeated , untied regular season in Academy history . The facility also alternates ( with Captain Tomb Field in Kings Point , New York ) as site of the annual Secretaries Cup game between the Coast Guard Academy and the United States Merchant Marine Academy ( known until the Coast Guard 's move to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 as the " Secretary 's Cup " game ) . In 2004 , thanks in part to a generous donation from the CGA class of ' 53 , the Academy installed a state - of - the - art FieldTurf surface at the stadium .
