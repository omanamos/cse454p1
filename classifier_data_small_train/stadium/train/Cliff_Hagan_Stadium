Cliff Hagan Stadium , or more fully Shively Field at Cliff Hagan Stadium , is a baseball stadium in Lexington , Kentucky . It is the home field of the University of Kentucky Wildcats college baseball teams . The stadium , which currently holds 3,000 , opened in 1969 as part of the Bernie A. Shively Sports Center , which also includes the school 's track and field facilities in an adjacent stadium . The stadium was renamed in 1993 in honor of Cliff Hagan , the Basketball Hall of Famer who had played at Kentucky during the 1950s under Adolph Rupp and returned to Kentucky as athletic director after his professional basketball playing days . It was extensively renovated in 2002 . As of 2006 , the stadium 's future is now uncertain . In the wake of the Wildcats ' surprising success in the 2006 season , which saw them win a regular - season Southeastern Conference title for the first time in over 30 years , coach John Cohen was signed to a five - year contract extension . A clause in the contract commits the university to either renovating or replacing the stadium . If construction on a new or renovated stadium does not start in 2008 or sooner , Cohen is free to walk away from the contract without a financial penalty .
