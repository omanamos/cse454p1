Beard - Eaves - Memorial Coliseum is a 10,500 - seat multi - purpose arena in Auburn , Alabama . The arena opened in 1969 . It is home to the Auburn University Tigers men 's and women 's basketball teams and women 's gymnastics team . The building 's exterior is primarily nondescript concrete , but its entry plaza is recognizable for the large " War Eagle " statue which also faces not only the rest of the university , but also nearby Jordan - Hare Stadium . A new arena is currently in the planning stages . The building was approved by the state legislature in 1965 to replace the Auburn Sports Arena , a small on - campus building in use from 1946 until the building of the Coliseum . The state supplied the majority of the funds , with the federal government , the University and an athletics department pledge drive making up the rest of the $6,033,597 needed . It was originally named the Memorial Coliseum , in memory of the Auburn war dead of the 20th century . In 1987 , it was renamed for Joel H. Eaves , a former basketball player and coach who guided the Tigers to their first Southeastern Conference title in 1960 and is the school 's all - time winningest coach . It received its current name six years later , adding the name of Jeff Beard , athletic director from 1951 to 1972 during some of Auburn 's best years athletically .
