The Joyce Center is an 11,418 - seat multi - purpose arena in South Bend , Indiana . The arena opened in 1968 . It is home to the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish basketball and volleyball teams . The main arena is the southern part of the Joyce Center ; it also houses the hockey rink in the northern half of the center and the Rolfs Aquatic Center ( which was added on in 1985 ) in the rear of the building . It is located across the street from Notre Dame Stadium , and the center 's two domes could easily be seen rising above the stadium 's east side prior to its expansion . The 10 - acre building , designed by the renowned sports architects at Ellerbe Architects of Saint Paul , Minnesota , was built in twenty - nine months , and opened the first week of December , 1968 as the Athletic & Convocation Center . It was renamed in 1987 to honor the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce , C.S.C. , Notre Dame 's executive vice president from 1952 to 1987 . Prior to the building of the Joyce Center , the basketball team played in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse , which opened in 1900 . In the fall of 2006 , the University announced major renovation plans for the Joyce Center . The south dome , which houses the basketball arena , will undergo a $24.6 million renovation and will be renamed Purcell Pavilion , after Phillip J. Purcell , a Notre Dame alumnus and trustee . Architectural firm HNTB studied the center after the university began considering renovations in 2001 and will work on the project . A start date will not be determined until all of the $24.6 million have been raised . The capacity though will go down from 11,418 to 9,800 . Notre Dame has a rich tradition of ending winning streaks at the Joyce Center . Some of the notable streaks the Irish have ended include . In 1971 , the Irish gave UCLA it 's only loss of the season . 3 years later , the Irish ended UCLA 's NCAA record 88 game winning streak . In 1977 , the Irish upset number 1 ranked University of San Francisco . In 1987 , the Irish upset number 1 ranked University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 60 - 58 . All of these wins took place in the Joyce Center . Alumni Hall ( Providence women ) • Allstate Arena ( DePaul men ) • Bradley Center ( Marquette men ) • Carnesecca Arena ( St .
