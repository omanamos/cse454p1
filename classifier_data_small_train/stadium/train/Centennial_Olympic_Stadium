Centennial Olympic Stadium was the 85,000 - seat main stadium of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta . Construction of the stadium began in 1993 , and it was complete and ready for the Opening Ceremony in July 1996 . During the week - long athletics program , the stadium bore witness to Donovan Bailey of Canada winning the 100 m in a world record time of 9.84 s ; Michael Johnson winning both the 200 and 400 metres titles , breaking the 200 m world record in the process ; and France 's Marie - Jos√© Perec also winning the 200 / 400 double . Meanwhile , Carl Lewis won a Olympic title , in the long jump . After the closing ceremony of the 1996 Paralympics , reconstruction began to turn the stadium into a new home for the Atlanta Braves baseball team ; the southwest corner of the stadium was prebuilt and configured to accommodate the baseball infield and seating , and this is easily seen in aerial views and diagrams of the stadium in its Olympic configuration . The track was removed , and the north half of the stadium demolished , reducing the capacity to 45,000 . Also controversially , the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games gave the USD $207 million stadium to the Braves rather than to the city , which owned the stadium it replaced . The stadium was renamed Turner Field , for the then - owner of the Braves , Ted Turner . After reconstruction was complete in 1997 , the 1960s - era Atlanta Fulton County Stadium , whose south parking lot the new stadium was built in , was imploded . The Georgia Dome was also a major stadium used at these Olympics . Turner Field : The Post Olympic Legacy of the Centennial Olympic Stadium .
