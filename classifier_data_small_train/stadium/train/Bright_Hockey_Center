The Alexander C. Bright Hockey Center is a 2,850 - seat ice hockey arena in Boston , Massachusetts , USA . It is home to the Harvard University Crimson men 's and women 's ice hockey teams . It is named for Alec Bright ' 19 , a former hockey player . In 1956 , the Donald C. Watson Rink was opened just north of Harvard Stadium at Soldiers Field , the area in the Allston neighborhood of Boston used by Harvard athletics , just across the Charles River from campus . The rink held approximately 2,000 people , but did not have many modern amenities . When plans were made to upgrade facilities , the $5 million cost became prohibitive , and the decision was made to renovate Watson Rink . In 1978 , following the hockey season , the walls were removed and the roof was extended before the new arena itself was installed . After a season without a full - time home , the " new " arena opened on November 19 , 1979 with an exhibition between Harvard and the 1980 USA Olympic hockey team . In November 2006 , Bright Arena was home to the 2006 Friendship Cup , the Cup 's debut year . Team USA Alumni , Team Canada Alumni , Team Gazprom and the Boston Bruins Alumni team all participated in the event . The Bruins defeated Team USA , while Gazprom defeated Team Canada .
