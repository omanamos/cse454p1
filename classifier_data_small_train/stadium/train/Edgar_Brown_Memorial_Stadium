Edgar Brown Memorial Stadium is the home stadium for the Pasco High School Bulldogs of Pasco , Washington . The school 's football and soccer teams play their home games at " Edgar Brown " , as it is commonly called . The stadium was built inside the bowl of a former gravel pit used in the construction of the Pioneer Memorial Bridge ( now referred locally as the Blue Bridge ) , which links Kennewick and Pasco , Washington . As well as being the home of the Pasco High Bulldogs , the stadium is home to the Pasco Invitational , possibly the nation 's oldest high school track - and - field single - day competition , which is always held on the first weekend of April . In 2002 , a voter - approved bond issue funded a major renovation of the stadium , which included the partial - demolition of the former Emerson Elementary which was transformed into a Boys & Girls Club . Emerson Elementary received a new building north of the stadium . A community - led fund - raising effort later added a FieldTurf playing surface to the stadium , making it the second stadium in the Tri - City area to have an artificial turf stadium ( Neil F. Lampson Stadium in nearby Kennewick was the first ) . It is a possibility that the stadium will also host the teams of the soon - to - be - built Chiawana High School Riverhawks in 2009 .
