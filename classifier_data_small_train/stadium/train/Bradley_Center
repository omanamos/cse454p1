The Bradley Center is an indoor arena in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . It is home to the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA , the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL ( and formerly of the IHL ) and the Marquette University men 's basketball team . It was also the former home of the Milwaukee Wave of the MISL from 1987 - 2003 , the Milwaukee Mustangs of the AFL from 1994 - 2001 , and the Badger Hockey Showdown from 1989 - 2002 . The arena was completed in 1988 at a cost of $90 million . It was meant to be a modern replacement of The MECCA Arena ( currently named the U.S. Cellular Arena ) , which was built in 1950 . It was a gift to the State of Wisconsin by philanthropists Jane Pettit and Lloyd Pettit in memory of Jane 's late father , Harry Lynde Bradley of the Allen - Bradley company . The arena seats 20,000 for end - stage concerts , 18,717 for NBA games , 19,000 for college basketball , and 17,800 for ice hockey . The Bradley Center is the 3rd oldest active arena used in the NBA ( behind Madison Square Garden and Continental Airlines Arena ) . The Bradley Center hosted the Frozen Four in 1993 , 1997 , and 2006 . The 2006 tournament was unique because the eventual champion University of Wisconsin Badgers had an unofficial home - rink advantage because of the statewide appeal of the Badgers and the location of the tournament in Milwaukee , just under 80 miles from the Kohl Center in Madison . The arena has played host for numerous WWE events as well , such as No Way Out 2002 , Taboo Tuesday 2004 . One of the most memorable moments in WWE history occurred in this facility when " Stone Cold " Steve Austin held Vince McMahon " hostage " at gun - point in October 1998 , until finally threatening to kill him in the ring . As he raised his weapon to fire , the weapon was revealed as a simple toy gun that fired a banner saying " BANG 3:16 " , causing McMahon to wet himself . WWE is planning to come with a RAW and Friday Night Smackdown SuperShow in early 2007 . Gwen Stefani was also going to appear at the Bradley Center on June 7 , 2007 for The Sweet Escape Tour concert but due to unknown circumstances the concert is currently cancelled .
