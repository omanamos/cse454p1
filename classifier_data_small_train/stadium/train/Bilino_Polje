Bilino Polje is the home football stadium of NK Čelik from the city of Zenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The stadium was built and opened in 1972 . It was used in Bosnia and Herzegovinas first match , a friendly played against Albania in 1995 with the final result being a 0 - 0 draw . The city of Zenica had to wait another 5 years before the next match of the national team was played at the stadium . This match was also a friendly , this time against Macedonia , with the final result being a victory for the home side 1 - 0 . Bosnian national team never being defeated on this field until the Euro 2008 qualifier against Hungary . NK Čelik was formed in 1945 as a club and played its home games at Blatuša . At the time , the stadium was mainly built with wooden stands and could have an attendance of 15,000 spectators . Zenica , being an industrial city and having Željezara as the main provider for most of the population of the city , needed to provide some kind of job offer for its hard workers . Now , the decision was made to built a larger stadium since NK Čelik was taking part in the Yugoslav First League . The stadium Bilino Polje was built at a historical place . The Ban of Bosnia , Ban Kulin , made some important declarations about Bosnia at the present stadium location back in the 11th century . Bilino Polje was built within a 6 - 8 month period , and was ready for NK Čelik to host European teams in the then Mitropa Cup . NK Čelik went on to win the Mitropa Cup the following year as well . A few years after the construction , the stadium was actually given the award for being the most beautiful stadium in Yugoslavia . Bilino Polje has the British style dimensions with a square look , rather than an oval look such as the Stadium Koševo in Sarajevo , which also makes it a beautiful and somewhat unusual stadium in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
