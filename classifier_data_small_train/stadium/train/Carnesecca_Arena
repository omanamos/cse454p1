Carnesecca Arena ( formerly Alumni Hall ) is a 6,008 - seat multi - purpose arena in Queens County , New York , USA . It was built in 1961 and renamed in honor of Hall of Fame Coach Lou Carnesecca in November of 2004 . It is the exclusive home to the St. John 's University Red Storm women 's basketball team , and also hosts the men 's team , mainly for games that are not expected to draw a crowd sufficient to fill Madison Square Garden . In practice , the men play virtually all their Big East home games at MSG and their nonconference home games here . The building hosted first round games of the NCAA men 's basketball tournament from 1970 to 1974 . As such , it is the last place in New York City that the tournament was held , since MSG is the home of the NIT finals and the Big East Conference Championship .
