ARCO Arena , originally called the Sacramento Sports Arena and later called the Original ARCO Arena or ARCO Arena I to distinguish it from its successor , was an indoor arena in Sacramento , California , USA . It held 10,333 people and was built in 1985 to temporarily accommodate the NBA 's Sacramento Kings , who had relocated from Kansas City . Located north of Sacramento 's downtown , ARCO Arena was nicknamed " The Madhouse on Market Street , " and Kings games were regularly sold out . Its official name of " ARCO Arena " is believed to be the first example of an NBA team selling naming rights to its facility : in this case , rights were sold to the oil company ARCO . The Kings left this building in 1988 to move to the new ARCO Arena , built just to the west . Today , the structure survives as an office building for Sprint Communications . On December 19 , 2005 , the California Department of Consumer Affairs moved their headquarters into the building .
