Assembly Hall is a 17,456 - seat arena on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington , Indiana . It is the home of the Indiana Hoosiers basketball teams . It opened in 1972 , replacing the current Gladstein Fieldhouse . The court is named after Branch McCracken , the men 's basketball coach who led the school to its first two NCAA National Championships in 1940 and 1953 . Indiana installed a new state - of - the - art playing surface during the summer of 1995 . The floor is the latest in court science , which includes added shock absorbers . The new floor also is permanent and covers the entire floor area . New bleacher seats were added , as well , along with a media row and end seating platforms on Lobby Level to give Assembly Hall a " new look " . Sportscaster Dick Vitale called for Assembly Hall to be renamed in honor of former coach Bobby Knight in a column for ESPN in 2003 . This was unlikely to take place , because the controversial Knight was fired by the university in 2000 . In 2005 the school completed construction of a state - of - the - art , $1.9 million scoreboard - video board . It is expected to pull in yearly advertising revenue without costing the athletics department any out - of - pocket expenses . Some Hoosier purists feared the advertisements , which had never before been in Assembly Hall , would ruin the aura and aesthetics . The building has hosted the NCAA basketball tournament three times , with sub - regional games in 1977 and 1979 , and the Midwest regional finals in 1981 .
