Bramall Lane Stadium is the home of Sheffield United Football Club in Sheffield , England and is the oldest major stadium in the world still to be hosting professional football matches . Built on a Sheffield road named after the Brammall family , who owned " The Old White House " on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street , it was originally opened as a cricket ground . It was also used for football games in the 19th century by Sheffield F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday but since 1889 it has been the home of Sheffield United . Bramall Lane is one of only two grounds ( the other being the Oval ) which has hosted England football internationals ( five games prior to 1930 ) , an England cricket test match in 1902 against Australia and a FA Cup Final Replay in 1912 , when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion 1 - 0 . It also regularly hosted FA Cup Semi Finals and Replays between 1889 and 1938 . The ground has also hosted rugby league games for the Sheffield Eagles , a Billy Graham Evangelist meeting in 1985 and even a rock concert for Bruce Springsteen in 1988 . The record attendance for the ground is 68,287 , set at an FA Cup 5th Round tie between Sheffield United and Leeds United on February 15 1936 . The ground has now been extensively renovated in the wake of the Taylor Report , and has an all - seated capacity of 32 609 . Bramall Lane opened as a cricket ground in 1855 , having been leased by Michael Ellison from the Duke of Norfolk at an annual rent of £70 . The site was then away from the town 's industrial area , and relatively free from smoke . It was built to host the matches of local cricket clubs and originally had six clubs playing there . It was managed by an umbrella organisation for these clubs ; the Sheffield United Cricket Club . Bramall Lane opened on April 30 1855 as a cricket ground with a match between " The Eleven " and " The Twenty Two " , A team representing Yorkshire played the first county match at the ground on August 27 1855 , against Sussex but lost by an innings and 117 runs . Although the first county game had been played eight years earlier , the official Yorkshire County Cricket Club was not formed until 1863 . The idea came from Ellison , who was using his own finances to support the club , in order to improve Bramall Lane 's financial position as the county 's headquarters . It was the club 's headquarters until 1893 , when they moved to Headingley in Leeds . In 1897 , Jack Brown and John Tunnicliffe recorded a first wicket score of 378 against Sussex—a ground record that has never been beaten . Brown 's score of 311 and Yorkshire 's innings of 681 for 5 declared were also records when the cricket ground closed . Other notable scores include the 681 - 5 declared Yorkshire scored against Sussex in 1897 , the 582 for 7 declared they piled up against Surrey in 1935 and the 579 posted against the touring South Africans in 1951 . 6 other scores in excess of 500 were made . In contrast there were a host of scores under 100 , mainly in the 19th century , although Derbyshire 's paltry total of 20 in 1939 remains the lowest ever score . Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 24
