Belk Gymnasium , known informally as The Mine Shaft , is a gymnasium on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in Charlotte , North Carolina . Completed in 1970 , it was the first on - campus home of the Charlotte 49ers basketball team . Before Belk Gym was built , UNC Charlotte 's basketball team ( then a member of the NAIA ) played at various high school gyms in the greater Charlotte area . As the full - time home of the 49ers from 1970 through 1976 , the team enjoyed a tremendous home - court advantage , going undefeated at home in 1974 , 1975 , and 1976 . When Charlotte joined the Sun Belt Conference for the 1976 - 77 season , Belk 's seating capacity ( approximately 3,000 ) was too small for the conference 's standards ; as a result , the team moved its conference home games to the old Charlotte Coliseum . From 1976 until the opening of Dale F. Halton Arena in 1996 , the 49ers ' women 's basketball team and volleyball team played in the Mine Shaft ; the men 's basketball team played lower - profile non - league games in the gym during that time period - at least one each season . With the opening of Halton Arena , Belk Gym was no longer needed as a host for intercollegiate activities . Its bleachers were removed in 2000 , and the main floor was removed in 2003 ; at that time , the overhead scoreboard was also removed . The facility now houses the Department of Intramural and Recreation Services for UNC Charlotte .
