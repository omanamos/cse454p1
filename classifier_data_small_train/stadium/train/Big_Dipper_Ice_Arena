The Big Dipper Ice Arena , colloquially known as " The Big Dipper " , is a multi - purpose arena in Fairbanks , Alaska . The arena is owned and operated by the Fairbanks North Star Borough . The Big Dipper was brought to Fairbanks from Tanacross in 1968 , and has undergone two major renovations since then . It is home to the Fairbanks Ice Dogs ice hockey team . Prior to 1968 , the building now known as the Big Dipper was an aircraft hangar located in Tanacross , Alaska . Constructed during World War II , the building saw little use after the war . In 1968 , Fairbanks High School hockey coach Hez Ray and a crew of volunteers undertook a project to move the derelict hangar to Fairbanks and repurpose it as an ice skating arena . The group purchased the hangar for a dollar and , using equipment donated by Fairbanks construction companies , dismantled the building and moved it to Fairbanks . The volunteers then reconstructed the building in its present location from the dismantled parts of the hangar . After rebuilding the hangar , the volunteers built an ice rink and bleachers inside , but due to a lack of resources the building itself remained essentially as it had been in Tanacross , without plumbing or heat .
