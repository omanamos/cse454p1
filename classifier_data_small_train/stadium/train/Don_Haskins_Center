The Don Haskins Center ( capacity 12,000 ) , the home of UTEP Miners basketball , is considered one of the top college basketball facilities in the United States and perhaps the best in Conference USA . With fans seated extremely close to the playing floor and the UTEP student section located near the opponent 's bench , " The Don " is so notorious as a tough place for opponents to win that UTEP has historically had difficulty convincing top - rated teams to play there . The Don is the home of the UTEP Miners who are the only Division 1 Men 's National Basketball Champions in the State of Texas ( 1966 ) . Built in 1976 as the Special Events Center , the venue replaced Memorial Gym . The Special Events Center was renamed after UTEP 's legendary Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins in 1998 .

The Haskins Center features a Robbins Bio - Channel Star maple floor , installed in the summer of 2002 , as well as two modern locker rooms , training facilities and basketball coaches ' offices . The gameday environment for basketball was enhanced in recent years with the addition of four new scoreboards and two video replay boards to the arena .
