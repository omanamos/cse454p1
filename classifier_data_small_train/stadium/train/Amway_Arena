Amway Arena ( formerly known as the Orlando Arena , TD Waterhouse Centre , and The Arena in Orlando , and colloquially known by the nickname of O - Rena ) is an indoor arena in Orlando , Florida . It is part of the Orlando Centroplex , a sports and entertainment complex located in downtown Orlando . The arena is home to the Orlando Magic of the NBA , Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League and beginning in fall 2007 , the arena will also be home to the Orlando Sharks of the Major Indoor Soccer League . TD Waterhouse , a division of Canadian finance company Toronto Dominion , purchased naming rights to the Orlando Arena in 1999 , and named the venue the TD Waterhouse Centre ( utilizing Canadian English ) . Before the Orlando Arena 's naming rights were sold , the other two buildings in the Orlando Centroplex - - Orlando Expo Centre and Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre - - utilized that spelling as well , so it was more than simply the fact that TD Waterhouse is a Canadian company that the building used the " Centre " spelling . Those naming rights expired on November 30 2006 , and TD Ameritrade , which bought TD Waterhouse 's U.S. operations earlier in the year , chose not to renew them . The venue was briefly known as " The Arena in Orlando " before the new naming rights contract was signed , a period of approximately one week . On December 7 2006 it was announced that Amway would become the new sponsor , renaming the building as the Amway Arena . Amway will pay $1.5 million over 4 years , or $375,000 a year , for the rights . Amway will also have an initial exclusive option to negotiate for the right to name the New Orlando Magic Arena . Amway founder Richard DeVos owns the Orlando Magic team . The nickname of the building for Predator games is " The Jungle " . During the 2005 - 2006 AFL seasons , the facility was referred to as Hummer Field at TD Waterhouse Centre . It is also the former home of the IHL 's Orlando Solar Bears , and also the RHI 's Orlando Jackals . Completed in 1989 at a cost of $98 million - entirely publicly financed - the arena seats 17,248 for basketball and has 26 luxury suites . The naming rights were sold in 2000 to TD Waterhouse at $7.8 million for five years . It is also used for entertainment events , particularly large rock concerts .
