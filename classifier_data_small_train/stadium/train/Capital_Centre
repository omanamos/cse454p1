The Capital Centre ( also briefly known as US Airways Arena and also known as the USAir Arena ) was an indoor arena located in Landover , Maryland ; a suburb of Washington , DC. Completed in 1973 , the arena sat 18,756 for basketball and 18,130 for hockey . It was renamed for corporate sponsor US Airways in 1993 , but reverted back to its original name of Capital Centre after the airline dropped naming rights . The arena was the home of the Washington Wizards of the NBA from 1973 - 97 , the Washington Capitals of the NHL from 1974 - 97 and the Georgetown Hoyas men 's basketball team from 1980 - 97 . The Wizards were known as the Bullets until 1997 , and played the first 20 games of the 1997 - 98 NBA season at the old arena . All three teams departed for the MCI Center ( now Verizon Center ) just north of The Mall in D.C. when it opened on December 2 , 1997 . The Capital Centre hosted its first NBA game exactly 24 years earlier on December 2 , 1973 , with the home team defeating the same visiting team , the Seattle Supersonics . During November 1973 , the Capital Bullets held their home games at nearby Cole Field House on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park . The ACC men 's basketball tournament was held there in 1976 , 1981 , and 1987 . The 1980 NBA All - Star Game and 1982 NHL All - Star Game were held there , as was the WWF 's Survivor Series 1995 . The Washington / Maryland Commandos of the Arena Football League also called the arena home from 1987 to 1990 . The Maryland Arrows , Washington Wave and Washington Power lacrosse teams used the arena , as did The Washington Warthogs professional indoor soccer team . The video documentary Heavy Metal Parking Lot was created by Jeff Krulik and John Heyn in 1986 in the parking lot outside this venue . It documents the heavy metal fans waiting on May 31 1986 for a Judas Priest concert ( with special guests Dokken ) . When the documentary was filmed , the venue was named the Capital Centre . The Capital Centre was home to several Toys For Tots concerts in the late 1970s and early 1980s . The arena was imploded on December 15 , 2002 to make way for The Boulevard at the Capital Centre , a town center - style shopping mall . The Capital Centre was the first indoor arena to have a video replay screen on its center - hung scoreboard . The video screen was known as the " Telscreen " and predated the DiamondVision video screen at Dodger Stadium by seven years . It was also the first arena to be built with luxury boxes and a computerized turnstile system . The Centre also had one of the NBA 's most notorious fans , Robin Ficker , who for twelve seasons sat behind the visiting team 's bench and heckled opposing players .
