City Stadium was the name of a football stadium in Green Bay , Wisconsin . It was the home of the Green Bay Packers of the NFL from 1926â€“1956 . It remains the home of the Green Bay East High School football team . Previously , the Packers had played their home games at nearby Hagemeister Park ( the site of East High School itself ) and Bellevue Park . Although City Stadium was the Packers ' official home field , in 1933 they began playing part of their home schedule at Milwaukee . They held 1 game there in 1933 , and after that they played 2 or 3 games a year in Milwaukee every year , a practice which actually continued through 1994 , after which they finally became solely based in Green Bay . The horseshoe - shaped stadium was made of wood and originally did not have any toilet facilities . It stood behind Green Bay East High School and next to the East River . The Packers used the school for locker room facilities . Visiting teams often dressed at their hotel before the game rather than use the lockers at East . The stadium originally sat 6,000 . It was gradually expanded to seat 25,000 , but by the 1950s that was still too small . The leaders of the NFL , including George Halas , informed the Green Bay club owners that they needed to improve their facilities or else the Packers would be moved to Milwaukee permanently . The citizens of Green Bay responded by building a new City Stadium , which opened in 1957 , and old City Stadium reverted to a high school field . The new stadium was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 and has become one of the most revered stadiums in the NFL . In recent years , ornamental fencing and monuments to the history of the field have been erected . Before the renovations , it was often referred to as East Stadium or Old City Stadium .
