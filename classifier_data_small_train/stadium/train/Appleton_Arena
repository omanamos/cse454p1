Appleton Arena is a 3,000 - seat multi - purpose arena in Canton , New York . It is home to the St. Lawrence University Skating Saints ice hockey team . It was named for Judge Charles W. Appleton , class of 1897 , the main benefactor of the arena as well as the riding center , which is named for his wife Elsa . Appleton Arena opened January 20 , 1951 , and was remodeled in the late 1970s and early 1980s to its current configuration . In 1999 , the facade of the arena was renovated to allow for improved locker rooms ( particularly for the growing women 's program ) and a larger lobby . Additionally , the playing surface was expanded to 85 feet by 200 feet , and a weight training facility was added . These renovations were specifically designed to improve the arena while only minimally changing the traditional wooden bleachers and general ambiance of the interior . Aside from being home to the Skating Saints , the arena also hosts intramural hockey and broomball games , Canton College 's hockey program , a figure skating club , and Canton Pee Wee Hockey . In addition to it 's athletic uses , the University has also utilized the arena for concerts and for an alternate , indoor location for graduation ceremonies .
