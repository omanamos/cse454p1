Bright House Networks Stadium ( formerly UCF Stadium ) is a stadium in Orlando , Florida , that is in the construction stages . Located on the campus of University of Central Florida , it will be primarily used for college football , and will be home to the UCF Knights football team . The Knights will move from their current facility , the Citrus Bowl , near downtown Orlando . The stadium will hold 45,000 people once completed and is currently slated to open in fall of 2007 . Its construction was briefly delayed due to the concerns of local residents regarding potentially falling property values and noise levels from the stadium . Initially projected to have a cost of $40 to $45 million , the most recent cost estimations run as high as $65 million . Most of the seats are of the metal bleacher variety , causing some to criticize its spartan looks and no - frills construction in the era of nine - figure sporting venues . It has been designed for potential future expansion to up to 65,000 seats . On May 9 , 2006 , it was announced that the 2007 Texas Longhorns will be the first opponent for the UCF Knights in the new stadium . The game will be held September 15 , 2007 , the first of three scheduled meetings between the schools . The encounter will be televised nationally on ESPN2 at 3:30pm . On August 8 , 2006 , UCF announced a fifteen - year , $15 million stadium naming rights to cable company Bright House Networks . There is a popular movement on the UCF campus to refer to Bright House Networks Stadium as The Dungeon , The Castle , The Keep , or The Knight House .
