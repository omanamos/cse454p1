Cameron Indoor Stadium is a basketball arena located at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina . Supposedly , the plans for the stadium were drawn up in 1935 by basketball coach Eddie Cameron . The stadium was designed by Julian Abele , who had studied at the Ecole des Beuax Arts in Paris , France . The same architectural firm that built the Palestra was brought in to build the new stadium . The arena was dedicated on January 6 , 1940 , having cost $400,000 . At the time , it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania . Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium , it was renamed for Cameron on January 22 , 1972 . The building originally included seating for 8,800 , though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day . Then , as now , Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats , including those directly alongside the court . Renovations in 1987 - 1988 removed the standing room areas and added seats , bringing capacity to 9,314 . Duke 's men 's basketball teams have had a decided home - court advantage for many years , thanks to the diehard students and fans affectionally known as Cameron Crazies . The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed Coach K Court in recognition of head coach Mike Krzyzewski . In EA Sports 's NCAA March Madness 2005 and ' 06 , Cameron Indoor ranked first in the top twenty - five toughest places to play . Additionally , Sports Illustrated ranks it fourth on a list of the world 's top 20 sporting venues , and USA Today referred to it as " the toughest road game in the nation " .
