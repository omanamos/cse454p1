Continental Airlines Arena is a multi - purpose indoor arena in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford , New Jersey . It is home to the New Jersey Nets NBA basketball team and was the home of the New Jersey Devils NHL hockey , and also was the home to the men 's basketball games of Seton Hall University . Official seating capacity as of 2004 is 19,040 for hockey ; 20,029 for college basketball ; 20,049 for NBA games ; and a maximum 20,000 for concerts . The arena attracts spectators and fans from much of the New York Metropolitan Area and not just New Jersey . Construction on a new arena across New Jersey State Highway 20 ( now 120 ) from Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack began in 1977 . Originally named Brendan Byrne Arena ( named after the sitting governor of the state , who was also a member of the ownership group seeking to bring an NHL team to the State ) , the arena opened July 2 , 1981 , with the first of six concerts by New Jersey rock musician Bruce Springsteen . This was followed by an ice show later that month . Although named after Byrne , many people and some tickets and press releases simply referred ( and still refer ) to it as Meadowlands Arena . On October 30 , 1981 , the Nets , who had played their previous four seasons at the Louis Brown Athletic Center at Rutgers University , made their debut at the arena , losing to the New York Knicks , 103 - 99 . Later that season , on January 31 , 1982 , the NBA All - Star Game was played at the arena . In 1982 , the Colorado Rockies of the NHL relocated to the Meadowlands and became the New Jersey Devils . Their first regular - season game , on October 5 , 1982 , resulted in a 3 - 3 tie with the Pittsburgh Penguins . College basketball arrived at the arena with the opening rounds of the 1984 NCAA basketball tournament . Seton Hall moved its Big East Conference men 's basketball games to the arena for the 1985 - 1986 season , enhancing a tradition that would soon become rich . The arena hosted the NCAA Men 's Final Four in 1996 , the last traditional arena to do so as of 2007 . On eleven occasions ( 1986 - 91 , 93 , 95 , 99 , 04 , 07 ) the arena hosted the semifinals and finals of the tournament 's East Regional . Only Kansas City 's Municipal Auditorium , which hosted 13 regional finals from 1940 - 52 , has hosted more . It also hosted the 1982 - 1989 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and 1986 Atlantic Ten Conference men 's basketball tournaments . Other teams that have called the arena home include the New Jersey Rockets of the Major Soccer League , the New Jersey Rockin Rollers of Roller Hockey International ; and the New Jersey Red Dogs / Gladiators of the Arena Football League . Two different National Lacrosse League teams have played at the arena â€” the New Jersey Saints from 1987 - 1988 , and the New Jersey Storm from 2002 - 2003 . The New York Cosmos also used the arena to host indoor soccer games . The venue also hosted WWF SummerSlam in 1989 and 1997 , as well as the King of the Ring tournament in 2001 and No Mercy 2004 , and
