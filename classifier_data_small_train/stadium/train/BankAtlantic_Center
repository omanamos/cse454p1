On October 30 , 2006 , Barbra Streisand was pelted with a beverage and , as her anti - GOP riff ended , another man in the crowd found himself being escorted out as he shouted at her . Streisand shrugged both incidents off , saying some people would do better to buy her records than come to her shows . A similar scenario unfolded during Streisand 's concert earlier in October at Madison Square Garden in New York , during which the singer used the F - word in shouting down a heckler . The Who recorded and filmed their performance here on November 20 , 2006 which was released on CD and DVD at themusic.com .
