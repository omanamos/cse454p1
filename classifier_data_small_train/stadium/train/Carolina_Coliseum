The Carolina Coliseum is a 12,401 seat multi - purpose arena ( for hockey , 6,231 seats as end seats are not used and seats are removed for the hockey surface ) in Columbia , South Carolina . It was the home of the University of South Carolina men 's and women 's basketball teams and Columbia 's main events venue until 2002 , when the Colonial Center opened . It is home to the Columbia Inferno of the ECHL . The facility is also home to classrooms at the university , with active classrooms used in the lower levels , and high school commencement ceremonies in the metropolitan region , as many school venues are too small for such ceremonies . The arena , opened in 1968 , was not designed for hockey , but as a result , the small rink ( about 175 feet by 75 feet , 25 feet shorter and 10 feet narrower than regulation ) has created an atmosphere which many ECHL coaches have called the toughest rink in the ECHL . Prior to the building of the Coliseum , the Gamecocks had played in Carolina Fieldhouse from 1927 until it burned in 1968 , and the Carolina Gymnasium ( now a theater ) prior to that . The Coliseum was the host of the NCAA Basketball Tournament East Regional in 1970 . Until 2002 , when Greenville 's Bi - Lo Center was a host , it was the only time the tournament was played in South Carolina . In 1977 , the Arena of the Carolina Coliseum was named " The Frank McGuire Arena " in honor of the Univeristy of South Carolina Head Basketball Coach , Frank J. McGuire after his induction in the Basketball Hall of Fame .
