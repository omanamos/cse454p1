Crisler Arena , in Ann Arbor , Michigan , is the home arena for the University of Michigan men 's and women 's basketball teams . Constructed in 1967 , the arena seats 13,751 spectators . It is named for Herbert O. " Fritz " Crisler , head football coach at Michigan from 1938 to 1947 and athletic director thereafter until his retirement in 1968 . The arena is often called " The House that Cazzie Built , " a reference to legendary player Cazzie Russell who starred on Michigan teams that won three consecutive Big Ten Conference titles from 1964 to 1966 . Russell 's popularity caused the team 's fanbase to outgrow Yost Fieldhouse ( now Yost Ice Arena ) and prompted the construction of the current facility . At Michigan men 's basketball games , the recently - added bleacher seats behind the benches are home to the Maize Rage student section . Despite being on a Big Ten Conference campus , the facility hosted the 1980 - 1982 Mid - American Conference men 's basketball tournament . It has also hosted Big Ten and NCAA gymnastics championships , the 1999 Big Ten wrestling championship , and other events . Previously , the arena was the full - time home to the men 's and women 's gymnastics teams and the wrestling team , before the opening of Cliff Keen Arena . The arena has also hosted concerts , perhaps most famously the opening show of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band 's 1980 Tour in which Springsteen began the show by completely forgetting the words to " Born to Run " but was rescued by the Michigan audience . Crisler Arena was designed by Dan Dworsky ( B'Arch . 1950 ) , a member of the 1948 Rose Bowl team . Among other structures that he has designed is the Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles .
