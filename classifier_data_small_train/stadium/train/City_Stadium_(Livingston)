The Stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle FC and the Livingston Development Corporation . Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston FC . When the LDC wound up , ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council . The Stadium has previously officially been titled the City Stadium due to a sponsorship deal with the City group ; it had also previously been called the West Lothian Courier Stadium . However since the club was taken over by the Lionheart Consortium , it 's reverted back to its original name , Almondvale Stadium . Almondvale Stadium is located near the centre of the Town of Livingston , approx . 10 miles to the West of Edinburgh and 30 miles east of Glasgow . It is named along with the Almondvale shopping center over the road after the area of the town in which it is situated . It is hired by Livingston FC from West Lothian Council every year .
