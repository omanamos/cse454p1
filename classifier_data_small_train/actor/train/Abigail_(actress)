Abigail ( born Abigail Rogan , 23 July 1946 , London , England , UK ) was an Australian actress and sex symbol in the ' 70s and ' 80s . She immigrated to Australia in 1968 . After arriving in Australia , Abigail landed several minor roles on both stage and screen , including the female lead in a local production of the comedy There 's a Girl in My Soup on stage . She became well known as a sex symbol through her role as Bev Houghton in the Network Ten sexed - up soap opera , Number 96 in 1972 - 1973 . As the show 's most famous sex - symbol many people assume that Abigail was the first woman to show her breasts on Australian television ; actually it was her co - star Vivienne Garrett in the same series . After leaving that series suddenly in 1973 she appeared in a Kings Cross revue in which she appeared nude , while struggling to find serious acting jobs . Apart from a series of brief cameo roles in a string of sex comedy films such as Alvin Purple ( 1973 ) its 1974 sequel Alvin Purple Rides Again , and a nude cameo in comedy Eliza Fraser ( 1976 ) the serious acting career never took off . She also made an attempt at pop career in 1974 and scored a hit with a cover of Serge Gainsbourg 's " Je t'aime . . . moi non plus " . Although this debut was a success , follow - ups including a comedic release with ventriloquist Chris Kirby , were not , and her initial success was attributed to her stardom and not her singing talent . In 1975 she appeared in Class of ' 75 for three weeks as a prim French teacher in a black wig and frumpy spectacles , and in 1977 she appeared in The Young Doctors as a super - efficient secretary . In the mid 1980s she took a regular role in yet another soap opera Sons and Daughters , playing the role of Caroline Morrell from 1985 until the series ended in 1987 . In 1989 she co - starred in Elly & Jools playing the crazy Country & Western Singer wannabe , Dulcie Dickson . In 1990 she was a regular cast member of short - lived soap opera Family and Friends and in 1991 appeared in Chances . In 1977 , she appeared as a guest star in Summer City , a film which is notable for being the first to have Mel Gibson in a major role . Her 1973 autobiography " Call Me Abigail " sold 150,000 copies in its first two weeks of sale . She now rarely appears in public . Interviewed on Sydney radio station 2GB on her 60th birthday , she currently lives on the Gold Coast , Queensland . Side A : 1 . Terry appears by courtesy of Chris Kirby .
