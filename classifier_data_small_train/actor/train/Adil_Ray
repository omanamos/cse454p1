Adil Ray ( born April 26,1974 ) is a British radio and television presenter born in Birmingham in England of Kenyan Pakistani parents . Adil Ray began his career as a radio host on a pirate radio station while studying at the University of Huddersfield and DJing at the university venue Black Hole . Later , during his placement year , he landed a job with a new small asian radio station in Birmingham where he spent the first half of the year , before moving on to Choice FM . When his placement year was up , Choice FM offered Adil a full time position , which he turned down in favour of completing his degree in Marketing . However , an arrangement was reached and he continued hosting for Choice FM on Weekends . After graduating in 1997 , Adil landed a spot with Galaxy 105 , a job that was a particular coup since it made him the first full time British South Asian presenter to host a mainstream Commercial Radio Show in the UK. Adil stayed with Galaxy 105 for 2 years . After spells with Century Radio in Manchester , Aire FM Leeds and Ministry of Sound Radio he joined the BBC to front the digital launch of the Asian Network . In 2002 , Adil joined the BBC Asian Network as a presenter to present the late night Adil Ray Show from 22:00 to 12:30 on Weekdays , a new innovative format which exposed new unsigned music talent yet chose not to take all things to seriously . With a mix of comedy and huge audience interaction the show became a launch pad for numerous artists whilst having mass appeal . In May 2006 Adil took over the drivetime slot ( 16:00 to 19:00 ) and now focuses more on Current Affairs combined with music and BritAsian comedy . He also co - presents Desi DNA on BBC Two and has also hosted the BBC Four programme Tales from Europe .
