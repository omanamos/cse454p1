Sir Alec Guinness CH CBE ( April 2 , 1914 â€“ August 5 , 2000 ) was an Academy Award and Tony Award - winning English actor who became one of the most versatile and best - loved performers of his generation .

Guinness first worked writing copy for advertising before making his debut at the Albery Theatre in 1936 at the age of 22 , playing the role of Osric in John Gielgud 's wildly successful production of Hamlet . During this time he worked with many actors and actresses who would become his friends and frequent co - stars in the future , including John Gielgud , Peggy Ashcroft , Anthony Quayle , and Jack Hawkins .
