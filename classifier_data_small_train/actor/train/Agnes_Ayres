Agnes Ayres ( April 4 , 1898 â€“ December 25 , 1940 ) was a silent film star in the 1920s . Born Agnes Hinkle in Carbondale , Illinois , she had planned to have a career in law , but in 1915 at the age of 17 she made her film debut at Essanay Studios in Chicago , and was signed by Fox Studios in 1919 . Moving to New York , Agnes gained popularity after being cast in Richard the Brazen ( 1917 ) , and was signed by Paramount Pictures in 1920 . During World War I she married Captain Frank P. Schuker . The marriage ended in Summer 1921 . Suddenly , and sensationally , in 1921 she shot to stardom when she was cast in what is probably her best know role opposite Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik . Agnes played the role for all it was worth , and became the envy of every woman alive as the love interest to the cinema 's sexiest new idol . Advertisements and lobby posters showed Ayres 's name was top - billed above Valentino 's . In October 1924 , Ayres revealed that , on July 13 , 1924 , she had married Mexican diplomat S. Manuel Reachi . Their daughter , Maria Eugenia , was born on March 25 , 1926 , in Los Angeles . She went on to have major roles in many other films including The Affairs of Anatol ( 1921 ) , Forbidden Fruit ( 1921 ) , and The Ten Commandments ( 1923 ) , but soon afterward , Agnes ' stardom began to decline . In 1926 she reprised her role as Diana in Valentino 's The Son of the Sheik . In Los Angeles , on June 10 , 1927 , she and Reachi divorced on the grounds of desertion and failure to provide . Ayres never remarried . In 1929 Agnes lost her fortune in the Crash , and her career ended with the beginning of talking pictures . Her voice was , according to trade journal reports , improperly pitched for sound pictures . Ayres went successfully into real estate after her film career was over and handled prime Beverly Hills properties . In 1940 Agnes Ayres died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 42 . For her contribution to motion pictures , she was given star along the Hollywood Walk of Fame , at 6504 Hollywood Boulevard .
