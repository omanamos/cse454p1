He currently stars as one of the main characters in ABC 's show Men in Trees , playing bartender / millionaire Ben Jackson . This is a role where he 's getting noticeable more main dialog and depth , then with his previous longtime characters on ER and Parker Lewis Ca n't Lose , which primarily consisted of supporting dialog and very little depth , although very likable characters . His recurring acting trademarks consists of the charming combination of his impressive 6ft - 7in stature and a very soft , humble voice . This was evident early in his career on Parker Lewis , where his charachter was feared , thanks to his big physique , mean roars and aggressive one - word lines , but whenever he struck up a dialog with Parker , his soft voice came trough , and his charachter was in fact a misunderstood kid labeled by his physique . The same soft humble acting was present in his character Jerry on ER , who is helpful , cheerful , and somewhat a pacifist . Other previous work includes playing Mose in the 2003 western Open Range . He is the son of Asher Benrubi , who is known as " Smash " to the St. Louis radio audience .
