Sir Alexander Korda ( September 16 1893 - January 23 1956 ) was a Hungarian / British film director and producer . He was a leading figure in the British film industry and the founder of London Films . The elder brother of future filmmakers Zoltán Korda and Vincent Korda , Korda was born Sándor László Kellner of Jewish heritage in Pusztatúrpásztó in Austria - Hungary ( now Hungary ) , where he worked as a journalist ( supporting the Hungarian Soviet Republic ) before going into films as a producer . He also worked in Vienna , Berlin , Paris and Hollywood , becoming director of United Artists . He worked closely with many artists on his films , including his Hungarian friend , painter and set designer Emile Lahner . The first film Korda made in the United States , in 1927 , was titled The Stolen Bride . By 1932 he made 16 more films in the U.S. The last one , Service for Ladies , was made in 1931 and released in 1932 after Korda had already relocated to London . It was in Britain , however , that he made the biggest impression , and in 1932 he founded London Films , soon to build studios at Denham , financed by Prudential , which eventually became a part of the Rank Organisation . His films were lavish and ( after the advent of colour ) visually striking . They included The Private Life of Henry VIII ( 1933 ) , nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture , and Rembrandt ( 1936 ) , both of which starred Charles Laughton , who was also to have appeared in the ill - fated I , Claudius ( 1937 ) . In 1942 , Korda became the first film director ever to be knighted . Among his greatest successes as producer were The Four Feathers ( 1939 ) , Q Planes ( 1939 ) , The Thief of Bagdad ( 1940 ) and The Third Man ( 1949 ) . The Red Shoes was also originally meant to be a Korda film and vehicle for his future wife Merle Oberon . It became a J. Arthur Rank film and was eventually made by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger instead , starring Moira Shearer . Korda was married three times , first to Hungarian actress María Corda in 1919 . They had one son and divorced in 1930 . In 1939 , he married film star Merle Oberon , but the marriage ended in divorce in 1945 . His last marriage was in 1953 to Alexandra Boycun , with whom he remained until his death three years later . He died at the age of 62 in London and was cremated . His ashes are at Golders Green Crematorium in London . The Alexander Korda Award for " Outstanding British Film of the Year " is given in his honor by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts .
