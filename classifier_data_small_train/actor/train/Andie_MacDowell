Andie MacDowell ( born Rosalie Anderson MacDowell on April 21 1958 in Gaffney , South Carolina ) is an American screen actress . MacDowell dropped out of Winthrop College as a sophomore in 1978 and signed with Elite Model Management . She appeared in print and television advertisements for the cosmetic and haircare company L'Oreal , a job she continued after she got her first role as an actress . A series of television commercials for Calvin Klein drew attention to her and led to her 1984 film debut in Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan , Lord of the Apes , a role in which her lines were rerecorded by Glenn Close because her southern accent was too pronounced . In 1985 , she had a small part in St. Elmo 's Fire , but her film career seemed to have stalled . Four years later , MacDowell hit her professional stride . Director Steven Soderbergh cast her in the 1989 independent film sex , lies , and videotape ; her performance earned her several award nominations and led to a series of starring roles in films such as Green Card , The Object of Beauty , and Short Cuts . As of 2006 , her biggest successes were in the box office hits Groundhog Day and Four Weddings and a Funeral . MacDowell was married from 1986 to 1999 to fellow former model and rancher Paul Qualley , whom she met while both were posing for GAP ads . The couple have a son and two daughters . She was married to Atlanta , Georgia businessman Rhett Hartzog from 2001 to 2004 . MacDowell currently resides in Biltmore Forest , North Carolina near Asheville , North Carolina . In Groundhog Day , a line from her character Rita in one of the film 's last scenes was changed from " let 's not ruin it " to " let 's not spoil it " . This was done because McDowell 's heavy southern accent distorted the word ' ruin ' , possibly making it difficult for the audience to understand her , and blurring the authenticity of the film , which was set in northwestern Pennsylvania .
