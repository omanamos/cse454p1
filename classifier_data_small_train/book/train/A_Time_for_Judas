A Time for Judas is a novel by Canadian author Morley Callaghan , published by Macmillan of Canada in 1983 . It tells the story of a man in modern times who discovers tablets written by a scribe named Philo of Crete or Philo the Greek . In the story , these tablets are from the time of Jesus and are Philo 's telling of Jesus ' last days and the aftermath , including his resurrection . This modern - day man writes a novel based on these tablets . The bulk of the real novel is the fictional novel , i.e. a retelling of sorts of Philo 's story . The title refers to the friendship between the scribe , Philo , and Judas Iscariot , the disciple who betrayed Jesus . The premise is that Judas was actually Jesus ' most trusted disciple , and chose him for the important job of " betraying " him to the authorities . In other words , Judas was following Jesus ' instructions . He tells his story to Philo , who writes it all down on papyrus , seals it up in a Greek jar , and hides it until it is discovered in the 20th century . The story goes that Judas hanged himself , not because he was ashamed of betraying Jesus , but because he had not kept the secret as Jesus had made him promise to do . This is almost an exact parallel to the recently revealed content of the controversial Gospel of Judas . Image : Books - aj.svg aj ashton 01b.svgThis article about a 1980s novel is a stub .
