A Song of Stone is a novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks , published in 1997 . A novel about an aristocrat 's experience of civil war . Abel and Morgan live in a small castle in an indeterminate place and time of civil war . They decide to abandon their home and join the refugees seeking safety . A group of irregulars led by " The Lieutenant " ( or " Loot " ) stops them and takes them back to the castle , which they proceed to fortify as a base . The soldiers loot the castle , and Morgan is seduced by Loot . A rival faction attacks the castle with artillery and Abel is taken along with the fighters on a counter - attack . When they return , Abel almost shoots Loot and there is a violent and nihilistic ending . A Song of Stone tells the frightening story of what happens when the normal rules of society break down . Themes of incest , violence and war are intertwined with the lives of the rather pompous but lyrical disgraced aristocrat Abel , the vacuous and submissive Morgan , and the ruthless Loot . With her easy and practical egalitarianism , and her soldiers with names like " Psycho " , " Karma " and " Deathwish " , Loot , the bloodstained insurgent is often seen as the most likeable character . The story is told by Abel to Morgan , in the second person . As the invaders systematically loot and destroy Abel 's family 's ancestral home , Abel seems ambivalent to what is happening . Later , when the Lieutenant suggests a memorial for Abel 's lifelong family retainer , who has just been killed , Abel and the reader realise that he does not know the servant 's surname . The violence of war is described in a highly graphical way . Stylistically , in its use of an unlikeable unreliable narrator , the book resembles John Banville 's The Book of Evidence and John Fowles ' The Collector . As in these books , the idea is that the reader comes to like the narrator a little in spite of their badness . Banks has acknowledged his admiration for J. G. Ballard and this also shows in this book . The geographical and historical background is deliberately vague in the book . There is some stylistic similarity with Inversions . Banks incorporated some previous work about the four medieval elements , and associated them with the four major characters in the book : fire with the Lieutenant , water with the noble , air with the noble 's sister , earth with the castle . The book was originally to have been called Feu de Joie , a reference to the custom of firing live rounds into the air as a celebration .
