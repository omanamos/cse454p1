20 Hrs. , 40 Min . : Our Flight in the Friendship is the title of a book written by pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart . It was first published in 1928 , but has continued to be reprinted in periodic new editions nearly 80 years later . In this book , Earhart writes about her experiences as a passenger in the Friendship , which made her the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air in 1928 ( she later accomplished the feat in a solo flight ) . Earhart combines actual log entries made during the flight with recollections of her childhood and how she first became interested in aviation . This was the first of two books Earhart would write in her lifetime ; the other being 1932 's The Fun of It . A third book credited to her , Last Flight , was published posthumously and consisted of diary entries from her ill - fated 1937 flight around the world . National Geographic named 20 Hrs. , 40 Min .
