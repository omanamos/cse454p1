The novel is a contemporary deconstruction of Shakespeare 's King Lear and is set on a thousand acre ( 4 kmÂ² ) farm in Iowa that is owned by a family of a father and his three daughters . It is told through the point of view of the oldest daughter , Ginny . Larry Cook is an aging farmer who decides to incorporate his farm , handing complete and joint ownership to his three daughters , Ginny , Rose , and Caroline . When the youngest daughter objects , she is removed from the agreement . This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long - suppressed emotions , as the story eventually reveals the long - term sexual abuse of the two oldest daughters that was committed by their father . The plot also focuses on Ginny 's troubled marriage and her difficulties in bearing a child and her relationship with her family . There are many similarities between King Lear and A Thousand Acres , including both plot details and character development . For example , the names of the main characters in the novel are reminiscent of their Shakespearean counterpoints . Larry is Lear , Ginny is Goneril , Rose is Regan , and Caroline is Cordelia . The novel maintains major themes present in Lear , namely : gender roles , appearances vs. reality , generational conflict , hierarchical structures ( the Great chain of being ) , madness , and the powerful force of nature .
