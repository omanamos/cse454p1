And in the foreword , Manning - Sanders discusses the long - ago roots of tales about giants : " The stories in this book are very old , and they come from many countries . We do n't know who first told the story of Jack and the Beanstalk ; but it has always been a favourite , and it used to be hawked around England in those little stitched - together pamphlets , called chapbooks , which travelling pedlars sold to the countryfolk for a penny or two each. " . The author adds : " You will notice that the giants , wherever they come from , have one thing in common : they are all very stupid , and the way to overcome them is to use your wits. " .
