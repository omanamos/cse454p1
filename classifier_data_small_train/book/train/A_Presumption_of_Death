A Presumption of Death is a mystery novel by Jill Paton Walsh , based loosely on The Wimsey Papers by Dorothy L. Sayers . These consist of a number or letters written by various Wimseys and published during the war . The novel is set in 1940 wartime England and features Sayer 's famous sleuth , Lord Peter Wimsey , and his wife , detective novelist Harriet Vane . Due to the origins of the novel , the first part of the book is written entirely in the form of letters between various characters , a device also used to introduce Busman 's Honeymoon . Harriet has evacuated her family to Tallboys , moving there with her three children , with the two children of her sister - in - law , Mary and with Bunter 's wife and children . Meanwhile Peter and Bunter are on the continent carrying out undercover work . While Peter is away a murder occurs in the village and the village policeman recruits Harriet to help solve the murder , partly because the police are too busy organising all the changes necessitated by the war and partly because as the wife of a detective , and as a crime novelist she is the best qualified person to find the murderer . Over the course of the novel Peter and Bunter return from the continent , Peter is retired from active service and is able to solve the mystery .
