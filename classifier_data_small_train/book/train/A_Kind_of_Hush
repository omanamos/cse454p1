A Kind of Hush is the 1999 autobiographical novel by Richard A. Johnson . The book describes a group a teenagers , who have all been sexually abused as children , ' getting even ' ( the original title of the book ) with child abusers and child pornographers . Johnson , who was himself molested as a child , writes that " Each of the boys is a part of me " . The title A Kind of Hush is taken from the song by Hermans Hermits and alludes to the difficulty that abused children have in telling others about what has happened to them . The book centers around a group of teenage boys led by Mick , who was sexually abused in care by ' Uncle ' Jack , a residential social worker . One of the boys acts as bait to lure nonces , who are then set upon and robbed . Sometimes they do 'specials ' , when the victim is someone who has hurt one of the gang in the past , like Tony 's foster father . Stu gets a job as a trainee chef and forms a very close , loving , and completely non - abusive relationship with his boss ' Chef ' and his wife Beryl . He then comes across one of his sisters by accident and learns that his father 's abuse of his sisters has descended into unspeakable depravity , also involving his little grandchild . The gang set about getting even with Stu 's dad and the paedophile ring that surrounds him . The book has been adapted into a movie of the same name , directed by Brian Stirner .
