A Graveyard for Lunatics is a mystery novel by Ray Bradbury , published in 1990 . It is the second in a series of three mystery novels that Bradbury wrote featuring a fictionalized version of the author himself as the unnamed narrator . The novel is set in 1954 , when the narrator is working as a writer at a Hollywood motion picture studio , and reflects Bradbury 's experiences working on the movies It Came from Outer Space , King of Kings , and Something Wicked This Way Comes . The studio shares a back wall with an adjoining cemetery ( as Paramount Studios really does with Hollywood Forever Cemetery ) , and most of the story takes place in those two locations . Two of the novel 's characters , stop motion animator Roy Holdstrom and autocratic director Max Wong , were based on Bradbury 's friends Ray Harryhausen and Fritz Lang . Another character , the shy , blond - haired autograph collector Clarence , may be an alternate autobiographical portrait of Bradbury , who as a teenager waited outside Hollywood studios for glimpses of movie stars . A Graveyard for Lunatics was preceded by Death Is a Lonely Business , and followed by Let 's All Kill Constance .
