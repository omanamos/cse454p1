A Man in Full is a novel by Tom Wolfe , published in 1998 by Farrar , Straus & Giroux . This 742 - page satire portrays a high - flying real - estate mogul amid the intricate social dynamics of Atlanta , the vibrant capital of the New South . Most of the mainstream American newspapers and news magazines gave the book positive reviews . However , a second wave of reviews in more highbrow literary outlets were more critical . Much of this more pointed criticism came from a cadre of established American novelists , including John Updike , Norman Mailer and John Irving . The book alludes to and caricatures some prominent members of Atlanta society , including the former mayor Bill Campbell , under the name Wes Jordan , and renowned developer John Portman , via the character Charlie Croker . Released eleven years after Wolfe 's bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities , A Man in Full was widely anticipated ; Wolfe was known to be working on the research for this follow - up effort for several years . The book on tape , in both the abridged and unabridged version , is read by American actor David Ogden Stiers . Image : Books - aj.svg aj ashton 01b.svgThis article about a 1990s novel is a stub .
