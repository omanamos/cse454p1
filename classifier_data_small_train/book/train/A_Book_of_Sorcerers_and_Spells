A Book of Sorcerers and Spells is a 1974 anthology of 12 fairy tales from around the world that have been collected and retold by Ruth Manning - Sanders . It is one in a long series of such anthologies by Manning - Sanders . In the foreword , Manning - Sanders writes , " Sorcerers and sorceresses work their magic spells in much the same way as wizards and witches ; and if you were to ask me what the difference is between a sorceress and a witch , I should say it is just a matter of dignity . You will never find a sorceress careering through the air on a broomstick , or bouncing over the ground in a wash tub . . . " . The tale The Mossy Rock involves the trickster Anansi , in spider form . This book was first published in the United Kingdom in 1973 , by Methuen & Co. Ltd .
