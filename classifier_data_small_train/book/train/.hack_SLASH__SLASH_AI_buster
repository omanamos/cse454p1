He is forced to help her and finish the event involuntarily , gaining an item " rae.cyl " . This is also traded to Lycoris . Hokuto manages to blackmail him into letting her into his empty friend 's list , and then into forming a party of the two of them . Due to this , Hokuto was able to see Lycoris . Albireo was also approached by Orca and Balmung to ask for assistance in resolving the " One Sin " , an event considered unbeatable . He declined however . Upon returning , he headed to the " One Sin " location . Hokuto met him there , and they witnessed Orca and Balmung defeat the boss character there .

Watarai had attempted to complete the event in order to delete the previously fragmented Lycoris . She informs him of the existence of Morganna Mode Gone and the fact that she was a failed prototype of Aura , and reveals the last fragment of herself , hidden in Albireo 's spear : " etaf.cyl " .
