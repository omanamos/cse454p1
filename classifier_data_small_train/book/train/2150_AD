2150 AD : A venture into the world of the future that can change your world now is a 1976 novel by Thea Alexander that was published in 1976 . The story concerns the character of Jon , who travels between his world of 1976 and the future world of 2150 , where the Macro Society dominates the Earth . The world of 1976 is referred to by the inhabitants of 2150 as the pinnacle of micro society . This book is based on the journal of Jon Lake , who lived in the 1960s and ' 70s as a psychiatrist . Because of his life experiences and accepting world view , his soul was considered evolved , or Macro , enough to travel to 2150 where his twin soul , Lea Nine , and soul mate , Carol Three lived . His astral form travelled to 2150 and he lived there while his 1970s body slept , and returned to the ' 70s during his waking hours . The book is centered around Macro Philosophy and concepts such as reincarnation , karma , twin souls and soul mates , as well as macro and micro limitations . Thea Alexander started a workshop for studying Macro Philosophy shortly before the book was published ; this information is on the back cover of the book . The story starts with Jon having an astral dream . He dreams he is naked - - and whole . He had lost one leg in the Vietnam War , and used a prosthesis ever since . He runs , and eventually encounters a beautiful woman , Lea . Lea explains that she is Jon 's twin soul , and that his soul has been brought forward to the year 2150 as an experiment by the Macro Society in that era . She takes him to a group of buildings around a lake , and connects his soul to a new , whole , adult body based on his body in 1976 that the members of the Macro Society had produced for him to inhabit while his soul was in 2150 . He is given a chance to meet a group of people who will act as his family in 2150 . He is also introduced to a computer system that exists to help people increase their awareness by answering questions and showing personal information , such as their past lives . One goal of the experiment is to raise Jon 's awareness to a level where he will be able to stay in 2150 , permanently . There are ten levels of Macro awareness , and Jon will have to reach level 3 before he is advanced enough for the Macro society to accept him staying in 2150 . When this happens , his 1976 body will die , or evolate . As Jon learns about the world of 2150 , he falls asleep . Jon wakes up in 1976 , and dismisses the 2150 world as a dream , though it seemed very real . His best friend and room mate , Karl , thinks Jon is having an escapist fantasy when he 's dreaming . He worries about Jon , but they arrange a bet : if possible , Jon will attempt to learn some of the Macro Powers practiced by the people in 2150 , and demonstrate them in 1976 . Over the next days , Jon is able to attain Macro Contact with a partner in his group ; this has unlocked some of his Macro powers . He convinces
