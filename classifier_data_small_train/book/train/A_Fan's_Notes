A Fan 's Notes is a relatively obscure though critically acclaimed novel by Frederick Exley , first published in 1968 . Subtitled " A Fictional Memoir " and categorized as fiction , the book is somewhat autobiographical . Though the events in this book bear similarity to those of that long malaise , my life . . .I have drawn freely from the imagination and adhered only loosely to the pattern of my past life . To this extent , and for this reason , I ask to be judged a writer of fantasy . Since it 's publication the book has been reprinted several times ( most recently in 1997 as a Modern Library edition ) , been heralded as a modern classic , and achieved a considerable cult following . The novel chronicles Exley 's depression at his perceived inability to measure up to the American dream and obtain fame and recognition . Wracked by alcoholism , Exley despairs that he is doomed to be a spectator in sports as well as in life . Exley 's introspective memoir , a tragicomic indictment of 1950s American culture , examinines in lucid prose themes of celebrity , masculinity , self - absorption , and addiction . A Fan 's Notes was made into a film in 1972 directed by Eric Till and starring Jerry Orbach as Exley . Image : Books - aj.svg aj ashton 01b.svgThis article about a 1960s novel is a stub .
