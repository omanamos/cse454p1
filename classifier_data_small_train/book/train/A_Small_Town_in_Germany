The novel concerns the search for an official at the British Embassy in Bonn who has gone missing with secret files . Bonn is the titular small town , chosen as West Germany 's capital after World War II mainly due to the advocacy of Konrad Adenauer , Chancellor of West Germany after World War II , who came from the area . A Small Town In Germany is set in the early 1970s in Bonn , which was , at the time , the capital of West Germany . A British Foreign Office official named Alan Turner arrives from London to investigate the disappearance of a minor functionary in the British Embassy named Leo Harting . Along with Harting , several secret files have disappeared . The head of security at the embassy , Rawley Bradfield , is hostile to Turner 's investigation . Despite this , he hosts both Turner and Ludwig Siebkron ( head of the German Interior Ministry , who is close to Klaus Karfeld , a German industrialist , who is building support for his new party with some success ) to dinner at his home Tuesday night . Turner starts off suspecting Harting was a spy , but comes to realise that Harting had been secretly investigating Karfeld 's Nazi career , and had become certain that Karfeld was the former admistrator of a wartime research facility that had poisoned thirty - one half - Jews ; and , in fact , is hiding not from the British but from Siebkron , and is probably planning to assassinate Karfeld . To Turner 's chagrin , Bradfield is not sympathetic to Harting 's situation , and not interested in protecting him . Bradfield regards Harting as a criminal and a political embarrassment . At the time of publication there were worries that the extreme right was rebuilding in West Germany . Real locations in Bonn such as the British Embassy feature prominently . John Le Carré had previously worked in the Bonn embassy . A Small Town In Germany does not feature John le Carré 's most famous character George Smiley .
