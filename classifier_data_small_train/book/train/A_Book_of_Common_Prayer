For the Anglican prayerbook , see Book of Common Prayer . A Book of Common Prayer is a 1977 novel by Joan Didion . It is a story of both personal and political tragedy in the imaginary Central American country of " Boca Grande. " . In 1983 Didion would publish Salvador , a book of essays on corruption and violence in El Salvador ; the fiction and non - fiction reflect a similar perspective of rage and despair . The novel is narrated by Grace Strasser - Mendana , an American ex - patriate who married into the family that dominates Boca Grande politics , the Mendanas . Grace was trained as an anthropologist under Claude Levi - Strauss , and later took up the amateur study of biochemistry , both attempts to find clear - cut , scientific answers to the mysteries of human behavior . Both attempts fail : Grace remains uncomprehending and cut off from the people around her , and in the final line of the novel she admits , " I have not been the witness I wanted to be. " . But Grace is not the novel 's central character . That is Charlotte Douglas , another American woman sojourning in Boca Grande , although her family ties are elsewhere . Charlotte 's beloved daughter Marin has run off with a group of Marxist radicals and taken part in an absurd act of terrorism , and in the wake of her daughter 's disappearance Charlotte 's marriage to a crusading Berkeley lawyer ( not Marin 's father ) , has fallen apart . Charlotte is dead before the novel begins . Image : Books - aj.svg aj ashton 01b.svgThis article about a 1970s novel is a stub .
