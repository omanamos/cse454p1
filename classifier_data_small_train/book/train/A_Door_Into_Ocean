A Door into Ocean is a 1986 feminist science fiction novel by Joan Slonczewski . The novel shows themes of ecofeminism and pacifism , combined with Slonczewski 's own mastery of knowledge in the field of biology . The novel is set in the future , on the fictional planet of Shora , a moon covered by water . The inhabitants of this planet , known as Sharers , are all female . Sharers use genetic engineering to control the ecology of their planet . They are peaceful beings who " share " â€” that is , they have a spiritual and linguistic union with each other and treat everyone equally . The Sharers take egalitarianism for granted because they share and they lack the concept of " power - over " , making their society one of peaceful harmony . When they are being threatened by an outside power , they resist nonviolently because they refuse to believe in power . With this spirituality , the Sharers can never be subdued by force .
