In Part One , the poet has various adventures , meeting the Roman ( dialectal ) poet Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli in the Sistine Chapel , and Pauline Bonaparte , sister of Napoleon , in the Pincio . Part Two consists of about seventy ( from a total of 2,279 ) amusingly blasphemous sonnets by Belli , purportedly translated by one " Joseph Joachim Wilson " , a descendant of the Roman man - of - letters Giovanni Gulielmi ( a character in Part One ) . An elaborate passage describes how the Italian Gulielmis were transformed into English Wilsons " during a wave of anti - Italian feeling occasioned by alleged ice - cream poisoning in the 1890s in the Lancashire coastal resorts of Blackpool , Cleveleys , Bispham and Fleetwood " .
