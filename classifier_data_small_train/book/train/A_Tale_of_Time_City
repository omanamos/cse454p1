A Tale of Time City was first published in 1987 by British author Diana Wynne Jones . It tells the story of a girl , Vivian Smith , who is kidnapped while being evacuated from London during World War II and caught up in a struggle to preserve history . In this novel , Jones explains time travel with more reference to our current understanding of science than she does in many of her other works . This story begins as Vivian is evacuated from London to the country during World War II . She is kidnapped by two boys , Jonathan and Sam , and taken to Time City , which exists outside of what they term ' History ' . Much of the action in the novel takes place in Time City , the purpose of which is to oversee the course of history ; their Time Police attempt to stop actions that would change history from the path that the city believes is correct . Jonathan and Sam kidnapped Vivian because they believe that she is the " Time Lady , " a figure of vaguely malevolent power for much of the story , and that she is causing trouble in history that could lead to the fall of Time City . Many of their beliefs are later shown to be incorrect . Though Sam and Jonathan quickly realize that they have the wrong girl , they cannot send Vivian back to her own century because it would draw the attention of the Time Police to their actions . The three are caught up in a search for four caskets , Iron , Silver , Gold , and Lead , that are integral to the existence of Time City , and , in the end , in an effort to save Time City itself from both the machinations of a family who wishes to rule Time City , and from the end of its predetermined existence .
