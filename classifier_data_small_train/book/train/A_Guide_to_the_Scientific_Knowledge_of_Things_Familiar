A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar , also known as The Guide to Science or Dr. Brewer 's Guide to Science , is a book by Ebenezer Cobham Brewer presenting scientific explanations for common phenomena of life . First published in the United Kingdom in or around 1838 , the success of the small volume was almost unparalleled , with over 319,000 copies and 47 editions being printed by 1905 in English alone . The popularity of The Guide to Science enabled Brewer to gather material for his Dictionary of Phrase and Fable . While the latest editions of this latter book remain a classic reference work , The Guide to Science itself has interest today only for the insight it provides into everyday scientific understanding during the mid - 19th century . The Guide to Science had its origin in a habit of The Reverend Doctor Ebenezer Cobham Brewer to enter into a book questions which he could not answer for himself . This book was set out in a question - and - answer style with a space being left for answers when they were obtained . Brewer bound his book into a volume and , disregarding advice from one man of science to burn it , sought to have it published . His initial offer to the publisher to sell the copyright for 50 pounds was rejected . Instead , the publisher agreed to publish the book at his own risk and under a profit sharing arrangement . The ultimate success of the book meant that this arrangement proved to be very profitable for both Brewer and his publisher . The exact date of the book 's first publication is uncertain , with some sources suggesting 1838 while others put the year at 1841 . Brewer himself said that the first publication was in 1840 . A second UK edition of the book was published in 1848 and 45 further editions were published over the next 57 years , including a 4th edition in 1849 , an 11th edition in 1857 , a 22nd edition in 1866 , a 38th edition in 1880 , and , finally , a 47th edition in 1905 . In all , over 319,000 copies of the UK editions of the book were sold - an almost unparalleled achievement at the time . The popularity of the book in the UK led to further publications around the world . Two different translations of the book into French were made and these translations were themselves translated and adapted into Swedish in 1858 and 1890 . Further translations were made into Spanish in 1858 and Portuguese in 1900 . In 1864 a revised version was published in the US . This edition was digitised and republished as part of the University of Michigan Library 's preservation program in September 2006 , thus making the work available to the public again for the first time in over 100 years . The object of The Guide to Science was to present answers to over 2000 questions about common phenomena . As a consequence , much of the book deals with explanations for questions the author had upon observing the world around him . In particular , there are questions dealing with the operation and effects of candles , stoves , chimneys and other important objects in everyday 19th century life as well as answers seeking to explain natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning ( including a mention of ball lightning ) , clouds , dew and rainbows . Brewer also intended that
