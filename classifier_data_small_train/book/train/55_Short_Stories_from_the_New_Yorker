55 Short Stories from the New Yorker is a literary anthology of short fiction first published in The New Yorker magazine from the years 1940 through 1949 . Although the magazine debuted in February of 1925 ( so that its 25 ' th anniversary was in 1950 ) , this 1949 book 's subtitle reads , " A twenty - fifth anniversary volume of stories that have appeared in the magazine during the last decade. " . As with the annual anniversary issue of the eponymous magazine , the cover depicts Eustace Tilley with his monocle , in the classic iconograph . The cover subtitles also include " 1940 to 1950 , " but the copyright date of 1949 suggests that material from 1950 , and possibly the latter part of 1949 , was not included ; individual years listed after " copyright " also recite each of the years in the 1940 's , but not 1950 . One story from each of 55 different authors is included . In the short Foreword , the editors state that " ome notable stories are missing " for purposes of balance , and also that " parody , nonsense , and casual essays " have been excluded as " outside the scope of this book. " . There is a conventional table of contents and an index lists each story alphabetically by its author 's last name . There is no other content , except the stories themselves . The Third Paperback printing is bound in matte paper , and is 5.25 " x 8 " in size , approximately the size of a trade paperback in 2006 .
