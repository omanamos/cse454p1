1635 : The Cannon Law is the second novel in the French - Italian plot thread , which began with 1634 : The Galileo Affair , in Eric Flint 's alternate history 1632 series , and was published by Baen Books in 2006 . In the view of the series creator " History " is not written by the actions of great figures , but by the many individual actions of everyday people acting on their own behalf . This attitude is reflected in such plot thread off - shoots which focus on events in other central locii , where the actions in large part are carried out by travelers , as the main thread takes place in closer proximity to Grantville , WV in it 's new home in central Germany in other works of the set . But like real places and events , such threads tangle and cross and affect one another , and that is the general character of the series , one part does not stand alone as if it were a separate sub - series , but the alternate history each book explores becomes a part of the setting and exposition in the others of later dates . Like all the books in the series since the initial exploratory 1632 ( novel ) , it is a work of collaboration between another and Flint . The rapidly growing Collaborative fiction book series that began with 1632 now numbers in the double - digits . 1632 - verse creator Eric Flint and Andrew Dennis have once again teamed up to put the Realpolitik of Early Modern Europe against the native hillbilly savvy of Grantville , WV 's rednecked embassy party against the wiles of Europe . Like all the preceding books in the series it is set in the Thirty Years ' War . The series deals with history and political life , American culture and a host of other things taken for granted in today 's First World countries . Novel : 1634 : The Galileo Affair , 2004 .
