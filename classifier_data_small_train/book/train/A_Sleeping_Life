A Sleeping Life is a crime - novel by British writer Ruth Rendell , first published in 1978 . It features her popular investigator Detective Inspector Wexford , and is the tenth novel in the series . It was shortlisted for the Mystery Writers ' Of America Edgar Award , making it one of only Inspector Wexford novels ever to have been shortlisted for either of the " big two " crime - fiction awards , the Edgar or the CWA Gold Dagger , despite the series ' huge commercial popularity . An Unkindness of Ravens was also nominated several years later . The body found under the hedge was that of a middle - aged woman , biggish and gaunt . There was nothing to give Detective Chief Inspector Wexford her address , her occupation or even her identity - let alone any clues which might lead to her killer .
