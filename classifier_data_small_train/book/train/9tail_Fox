9tail Fox is a 2005 novel by Jon Courtenay Grimwood . The plot centres around Bobby Zha , a Sergeant at the fictional SFPD Chinatown station in San Francisco . The claimed shooting of a burglar by eleven - year - old Natalie Persikov conflicts with Zha 's intuition on the matter , but before he has a real chance to investigate he is shot himself . After meeting the Jinwei hu ( the nine - tailed fox of the title ) while dead , Bobby wakes up in a hospital . However , there are a few surprises for him on waking ; not least that apparently he is n't Bobby Zha anymore . The doctors tell him he 's in New York , not San Francisco ; he was never shot ; and that he 's Robert Van Berg , sole survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents and put him into a coma since he was fifteen . Now adult and sole inheritor of his family 's considerable fortune , Bobby wastes no time in getting back to the west coast to investigate . In between looking into the case of his own murder , finding out what really happened at the Persikov 's house and following up the leads from his contacts among the homeless of San Francisco , Bobby becomes increasingly concerned over his own identity . Changing identities at a whim — an FBI agent , a CIA investigator , a special forces agent direct from the White House — he questions his old acquaintances about Sergeant Zha , finding out more about himself than he ever knew . The novel is set " a few years in the future " , and frequently references Soviet author Mikhail Bulgakov . Grimwood notes in the Acknowledgments that " the choice of Persikov for Dr Misha 's surname is entirely intentional. " . This article does not cite any references or sources .
