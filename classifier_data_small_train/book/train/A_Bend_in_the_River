A Bend in the River ( ISBN 0 - 8446 - 6631 - 9 ) is a 1979 novel by Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul . Set in an unnamed African country after independence , the book is narrated by Salim , an ethnically Indian Muslim and a shopkeeper in a small , growing city in the country 's remote interior . Though born and raised in another country in a more cosmopolitan city on the coast ( likely Mombasa ) during the colonial period , as neither European nor fully African , Salim observes the rapid changes in his homeland with an outsider 's distance . Although Salim never identifies the country where he lives , the events closely parallel the Belgian Congo 's transformation into Zaire under Mobutu Sésé Seko ( the novel 's " Big Man " ) - with the unnamed city in which the novel is set having some similarity with the Zairean river port of Kisangani . Others see a resonance with Idi Amin 's Uganda . The first sentence of the book is considered emblematic of Naipaul 's world view : " The world is what it is ; men who are nothing , who allow themselves to become nothing , have no place in it. " . A Bend in the River was short - listed for the Booker Prize in 1979 .
