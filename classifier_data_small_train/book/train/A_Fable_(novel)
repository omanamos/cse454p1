A Fable was written in 1954 by William Faulkner and won him both the Pulitzer prize and the National Book Award in 1955 . Despite these recognitions , however , the novel received mixed critical reviews and a reputation as one of Faulkner 's lesser works . The author , on the other hand , spent over a decade and tremendous effort on A Fable , and considered it his masterpiece when it was completed . Historically , it can be seen as a precursor to Catch 22 . The book takes place in France during World War I and stretches throughout one week . It tells the stories of " Corporal Zsettslani " , who is representative of Jesus . The Corporal orders 3,000 troops to disobey orders to attack in the brutally repetitive trench warfare . In return , the Germans do not attack , and the war is simply stopped when the soldiers realize that it takes two sides to fight a war . The Generalissimo has the corporal arrested and executed ; he is representative of leaders who use war solely to make themselves stronger ( he invites the German general over to discuss how to start the war again ) . Before he has him shot , the generalissimo tries to convince the Corporal that war can never be stopped because it is the essence of humanity .
