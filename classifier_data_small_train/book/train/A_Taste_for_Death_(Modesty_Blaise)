Willie and Dinah go into hiding , knowing that Gabriel can mobilize the entire Panamanian underworld to search for Dinah . Modesty comes to their aid , and a deadly cat - and - mouse game ensues , with both Modesty and Willie barely surviving traps that should not possibly be survivable . Back in England , Modesty encounters Simon Delicata , a huge man with an ape - like build , and strength to match . A friend of Sir Gerald Tarrant is dead , and Simon Delicata is the killer . And Willie knows Simon Delicata from long ago , having been beaten senseless and near - fatally injured by him in a barroom fight .
