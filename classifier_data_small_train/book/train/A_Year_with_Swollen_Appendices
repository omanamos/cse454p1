A Year with Swollen Appendices is a book by Brian Eno . The book published by Faber and Faber in 1996 is divided into two sections . The first part is a diary covering the year 1995 , the second part , the 'swollen appendices ' of the title is a collection of essays , short stories and correspondence . The cover photograph is by Anton Corbijn . I did it because I wanted to schedule in advance some of the things that Anthea and I do n't get round to doing often enoughâ€” going to the cinema , the theatre , galleries and so on . The preplanning idea failed within weeks . . . The diary covers the year 1995 , which proved to be particularly productive for Eno . It details four different musical projects he was involved in , the album Spinner with Jah Wobble , the U2 project Passengers Original Soundtracks 1 , David Bowie 's Outside and the War Child Charity album The Help Album as well as exploratory sessions with the band James . In addition it covers various other projects Eno was involved in , in particular his opposition to the attacks on Bosnia by Croatia . Throughout the diaries there is correspondence between Eno and Stewart Brand , largely dealing with this subject . The appendices which in the original book are delineated by pink paper , cover a number of different topics with some of the writing dating as far back as 1978 . The essays cover subjects closely linked with Eno such as Ambient music , Generative music , Music copyright , the role of an artist and art . In addition there is correspondence , interviews and short stories . In 2007 , Canongate Books will reprint the book with a new introduction from Eno in which he looks back at what has happened in the ten years since it was first published .
