A Short , Sharp Shock is a novel written by Kim Stanley Robinson and published in 1990 . Though Robinson works primarily in the field of science fiction , A Short , Sharp Shock is set in a fantasy world which features , among other things , a tribe who live in close connection to the small trees which grow out of their shoulders . The protagonist is a man who awakens on a beach with no memory , and who finds himself compelled to pursue a woman who awoke with him , a woman he knows only as the swimmer . Their journey takes them along the narrow strip of land , surrounded by ocean , which makes up the whole world . The content is unlike anything found elsewhere in Robinson 's oeuvre , yet the themes remain very similar . The strong link between the human characters and the natural world connects directly to the ecological themes of his previous work , especially the Mars Trilogy , but the loose and dreamlike structure is like nothing else he has written . The phrase " Short , sharp shock " is taken from Gilbert and Sullivan 's operetta The Mikado .
