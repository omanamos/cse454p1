A Daughter of the Snows ( 1902 ) , Jack London 's first novel , is little read today . It is , however , notable for its heroine , Frona Welse ( whose name echoes that of his mother , Flora Wellman ) . Frona is a strong and self - reliant woman , one of many who would people his fiction . It is also notable for a racist sensibility which is also detectable in some of his other work . A character says : " We are a race of doers and fighters , of globe - encirclers and zone - conquerors . . . All that the other races are not , the Anglo - Saxon , or Teuton if you please , is. " . Such sentiments were common currency in Jack London 's time and he places them in the mouths of characters , not the narrator .
