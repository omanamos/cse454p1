A Book of Enchantments and Curses is a 1977 anthology of 13 fairy tales from around the world that have been collected and retold by Ruth Manning - Sanders . It is one in a long series of such anthologies by Manning - Sanders . The Russian tale Vasilissa Most Lovely involves the witch Baba Yaga . In her introduction , Manning - Sanders writes : " . . .f we were to say that a girl was enchanted . . . t would mean that the poor thing was under a spell , from which we must do all in our power to free her . We all know what it means , but nobody seems to know just how it came to have that meaning . At any rate , a curse is always a bad thing , never a good . The person upon whom it is laid is in for a very hard time ; and it generally takes all the heroic courage and ingenuity of some brave soul to lift it. " . Some of tales from this book are recollected in Folk and Fairy Tales ( 1978 ) by Manning - Sanders . 13. Catrinella , Come up Higher ! .
