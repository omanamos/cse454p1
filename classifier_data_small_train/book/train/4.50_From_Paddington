4.50 From Paddington ( published in 1957 ; in the United States it was initially published under the title What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw ! ) , is a mystery , detective novel by Agatha Christie . It features Miss Marple . Elspeth McGillicuddy is a woman not usually given to hallucinations . But when she witnesses what appears to be a woman being strangled on a train and no one else sees it , no one reports it and no corpse is found , she turns to her old friend Jane Marple to help solve the puzzle . Miss Marple asks her highly efficient and intelligent young acquaintance , Lucy Eyelesbarrow , to infiltrate the Crackenthorpe family , who live at Rutherford Hall , and seem to be at the heart of the mystery , to help unmask the murderer . Elspeth McGillicuddy has come down from Scotland to visit her old friend , Jane Marple . On the way , she sees a woman strangled in a passing train . Only Miss Marple believes her and they set about to solve the mystery . The first task is to ascertain where the body could have been dumped off of the train , and then hidden . Comparison of the facts of the murder with the train timetable and the local geography lead to Rutherford Hall as the only possible location . Miss Marple calls upon an acquaintance , Lucy Eyelesbarrow , who is a professional nanny and child - sitter . Lucy agrees to take a position with the Crackenthorpes , and the hunt is on . Rutherford Hall was built by Josiah Crackenthorpe , purveyor of tea biscuits . His son , Luther , is now a semi - invalid widower who had displayed spendthrift qualities in his youth . To preserve the family fortune , Josiah 's will provided Luther with a home and income for life but otherwise left everything in trust for the grandchildren . They share equally in the estate , but only if they live long enough to inherit it . Edmund Crackenthorpe and Edith Crackenthorpe Eastley died during the War . That leaves Cedric , a painter and lover of women who lives on Ibiza ; Harold , a cold and stuffy banker with a hidden passion for the ballet ; Alfred ; and Emma Crackenthorpe , a spinster who lives at home and takes care of Luther . The brothers are visiting for Luther 's birthday , as are Edith 's husband , Brian Eastley , and their son Alexander . Also in the story are other servants , and Dr. John Quimper , who looks after Luther 's health and is secretly engaged to Emma . Enter Lucy , who uses golf practice as an excuse to search the grounds for clues to the murdered woman . She eventually finds the body in a sarcophogus in amongst Luther 's collection of dubious statuary in the stables . Her clothes are traced to France , and Emma reveals that she has received a letter from some women named Martine . Martine 's letter claims she was married to Edmund during the War ; they had a child ; and she now wishes her son to have all of the advantages to which his birth properly entitles him . Lucy reports periodically to Miss Marple and they arrange a visit to the house . One thing leads to another as the plot thickens ; and so does the curry , which is mysteriously laced with arsenic . It makes everybody sick ,
