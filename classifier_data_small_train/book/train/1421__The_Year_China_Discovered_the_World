1421 : The Year China Discovered the World is a controversial book written by retired submarine commander Gavin Menzies . It was first published in 2002 in Great Britain and was published in the United States under the title 1421 : The Year China Discovered America . It has been translated into several languages other than English . On some early European world maps , it appears that someone had charted and surveyed lands supposedly unknown to the Europeans . Menzies first analyzes the nations capable of sending missions to the " ends of the earth " , from Venice to Tamerlane 's empire . He concludes that only China had the time , money , manpower and leadership to send such expeditions . The book then sets out to prove that the Chinese visited these unknown lands . Menzies produces what he calls " indisputable evidence " that the Chinese visited the Americas and other lands unknown to Europeans , made attempts to reach both the North and South Poles , and circumnavigated the world before Ferdinand Magellan . This is known as the 1421 hypothesis . After the section " The Voyage of Yang Qing " , Menzies discusses the first European attempts to colonize the New World and identifies the maps he used as evidence for his theories . Many in China , however , are impressed with Menzies ' efforts . The Hall of Maat , Weighing the evidence for alternate history .
