Abeng ( Ä běng ) is a novel published in 1984 by Michelle Cliff . It is a quasi - autobiographical novel about a white Jamaican girl growing up in the 1950s . It explores the historical repression that resulted from British imperialism in Jamaica . Facts regarding imperialism of the island are dispersed throughout the narrative , as well as facts about slavery in Jamaica and Jamaican folklore . It is emphasized that the protagonists are generally unaware of these facts , which often serve to reveal the brutal nature of the both slavery and imperialism . In this way Cliff reveals her intentions for the book . It is a piece of revisionist literature meant to counteract Britain 's cultural imperialism in Jamaica . Abeng is an African word , which means conch shell , specifically one which can be used as a horn by blowing in one end . The abeng has had two historical uses in Jamaica . It was used by slaveholders to summon slaves to the sugar fields . It was also used by the Maroon army as a method of communication . In a recent lecture at the University of St. Thomas , Cliff said that the title was a reference to both of these uses , though neither appears in the novel 's text ( they are referenced in the book 's frontpiece ) . She further explained that the title is an attempt to " take back " Jamaican history .
