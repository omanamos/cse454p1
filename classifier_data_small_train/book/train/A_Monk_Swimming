A Monk Swimming ( 1998 ) is a memoir by Malachy McCourt . It is about McCourt 's life in Limerick , Ireland and what he left behind when he came to America . The book recounts the journey and the many obstacles that McCourt had to overcome . After first working as a longshorman laborer , he was able to open a successful Manhattan tavern frequented by entertainment celebrities , and appeared on television talk shows , although neglecting his wife and child . This Memoir picks up roughly where Frank McCourt , the author 's older brother left off at the end of his Pulitzer Prize winning Angela 's Ashes . This book was written and published before the elder McCourt published his own sequels , ' Tis & Teacher Man . Malachy McCourt 's account of his early years in New York City and its surrounding areas lends a different , if not all together more brusk , account of the McCourt Brothers respective returns to their native United States . As a result of this dichotomy , the reader sees the already weakened facade of his faith come roaring down in the Bible - tossing incident spurred by his boss ' intrusion upon one of Malachy 's beach bungalow bedroom dates . This seems to be tied to their banning of homosexual groups from marching in the New York City St. Patrick 's Day Parade . A Monk Swimming is similar to the memoir Angela 's Ashes ( 1996 ) by his older brother Frank McCourt . The title is a mondegreen of " amongst women " - a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer , Hail Mary . The book is dedicated to New York City politician , humanitarian , and fellow Irishman Paul O'Dwyer who at the time of first publication had recently passed away . McCourt and O'Dwyer had been close friends and politically like - minded .
