A Faerie Ring is romantic fantasy novel by Canadian author Michael Honeth . It was self - published in 2005 . At first glance , A Faerie Ring is a contemporary fairy tale for adults and young adults , which touches on a number of issues such as multiculturalism , ethics and morality . The book hides a twist , however . Through careful use of names and wording , the book can be re - read as a continuation of the first reading , where the characters shift a generation . Re - reading A Faerie Ring this way answers questions that appear to have been omitted at first . Apart from the obvious clue of the bookâ€™s name , the author encourages the reader to closer inspection by linking the first and last chapters .
