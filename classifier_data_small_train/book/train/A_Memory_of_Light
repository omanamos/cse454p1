A Memory of Light is a working title for the twelfth book of the popular The Wheel of Time fantasy series written by American author Robert Jordan . It will be published by Tor Books . Tor has confirmed that it will be released in early 2009 ; it will conclude the series , which began in 1990 with The Eye of the World . Robert Jordan has repeatedly said that the main sequence will conclude with this book . Numerous times he said that he will hold to this statement even if he has to make it 2000 pages long . More recently , at ComicCon 2006 , Jordan said he would " finish the story in one more book even if it takes 1500 pages hardcover. " . According to dragonmount.com , he has said " . . .it is not possible for him to write two more coherent books . He said he might get one coherent book , and one incoherent , or two semi - coherent , so The Wheel of Time would be finished by book 12. " . Robert Jordan does , however , plan to write two other prequel novels in addition to New Spring ( about Lan and Moiraine finding Rand al'Thor ) and possibly two or three other side - plot novels , one of which is said to be about Mat Cauthon and Tuon , 10 years after Tarmon Gai'don . Recently , Robert Jordan has been diagnosed with the rare blood disease amyloidosis , and the twelfth installment of this series may be released later than expected as a result . See below in ' External links ' for more information . On January 22 , 2007 , Jordan 's blog announced that Jordan 's Lambda light chain levels have dropped to a rating 2.70 ( where 1.0 to 3.0 is considered normal and healthy ) . This level refers to the amount of amyloid - like material found on examination ; it is this level that gives prognostic information to physicians . It should be noted that this is the first time since his diagnosis in March 2006 that Jordan 's Lambda light chains have been within the normal range .
