A Good Man in Africa ( 1981 ) is William Boyd 's first novel . It is a dark comedy about a drunken diplomat who is being blackmailed by a local politician whilst the country slowly falls into chaos . The novel was written in only three months after Boyd procured a publishing deal from Hamish Hamilton , having implied that the book was almost finished when , in fact , it had n't been started . In the figure of Morgan Leafy , a hapless British diplomat struggling to master the complexities of his posting to a corrupt west African country ( the fictional Kinjanja ) , Boyd echoes the post - war formula of Angry Young Men . His bumbling , gauche , but ultimately sympathetic protagonist , Morgan Leafy pursues his love interest through a series of career crises and ham - fisted sexual encounters , ' an aristocrat of pain and frustration , a prince of anguish and embarrassment ' , until he eventually regains his girl , and his self - respect , against all the odds of his situation . Boyd’s first novel also hints at his sensitivity to Africa as a continent bedeviled by poverty , exploitation and misguided foreign interference . His portrait no doubt builds on his own childhood experiences in Ghana , something he discusses in the autobiographical essay included in Protobiography ( 1998 ) . Though perpetually self - absorbed , Leafy nonetheless registers the misery and decrepitude of his surroundings in the overpopulated capital of Nkongsamba : " Set in undulating tropical rain forest , from the air it resembled nothing so much as a giant pool of vomit on somebody’s expansive unmown lawn. " . While the plot of A Good Man is driven by a comedy of diplomatic manners , the novel also conveys the heat , sweat , and endless frustrations of a crumbling post - imperial system , with the chaos of a continent throwing into relief a legacy of British incompetence .
