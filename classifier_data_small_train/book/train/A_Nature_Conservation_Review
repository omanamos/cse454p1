A Nature Conservation Review was a 2 - volume work by Derek Ratcliffe , published by Cambridge University Press in 1977 . It set out to identify the most important places for nature conservation in Great Britain . It is often known by the acronym NCR , and sites listed in it are termed " NCR sites " . The approach adopted by Ratcliffe was adapted and applied to the selection of sites important for geological conservation in the Geological Conservation Review . A Marine Nature Conservation Review has also been published . Volume 1 set out the rationale and methods used , and gave descriptions of the major habitat types . Volume 2 consisted entirely of a site inventory .
