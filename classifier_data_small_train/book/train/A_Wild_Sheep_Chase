A Wild Sheep Chase ( 羊をめぐる冒険 , Hitsuji o meguru bōken ? ) is a novel published in 1982 by Japanese author Haruki Murakami . It is the sequel to Pinball , 1973 , and is the third book in Murakami 's " Trilogy of the Rat " . In A Wild Sheep Chase , Murakami blends elements of American literature with Japanese contexts , exploring post - WWII Japanese cultural identity . The book is part mystery and part fantasy with a post - modern twist . This mock - detective tale follows an unnamed Japanese man through Tokyo and Hokkaidō in 1978 . The passive , neurotic , chain - smoking main character gets swept away on an adventure that leads him on a hunt for a sheep that hasn’t been seen for years . The apathetic protagonist meets a woman with magically seductive ears and a strange man who dresses as a sheep and talks in slurs ; in this way there are elements of Japanese animism or Shinto . Murakami wrote a sequel to this book , entitled Dance Dance Dance , which also follows the adventures of an unnamed protagonist and the Sheep Man . However , its plot , tone and the majority of the characters are sufficiently different that Dance Dance Dance can be seen as separate from the " Trilogy of the Rat. " . A Wild Sheep Chase ( English edition ) by Haruki Murakami ; translated by Alfred Birnbaum . Image : Books - aj.svg aj ashton 01b.svgThis article about a 1980s novel is a stub .
