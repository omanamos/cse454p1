Ayatollah Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini Beheshti ( Persian : محمد حسینی بهشتی ) , ( October 24 , 1928 - June 28 , 1981 ) was an Iranian cleric , the secretary - general of the Islamic Republic Party , and the head of the Islamic Republic 's judicial system . He was assassinated together with more than seventy members of the Islamic Republic party on June 28 , 1981 . Beheshti was born in Isfahan and studied both at the University of Tehran and under Allameh Tabatabaei in Qom . Between 1960 and 1965 , he led the Islamic Center in Hamburg , where he was responsible for the spiritual leadership of religious Iranian students in Germany and Western Europe . In Hamburg , he also worked with Mohammad Khatami and was among his influences . Since the early 1960s , he was involved in activities against the monarchy and was arrested several times by the Shah 's secret police , the SAVAK . Following the Iranian Revolution , he became one of the original members of the Council of Revolution of Iran and soon its chairman . In the first post - revolutionary Iranian parliament , he led the Islamic Republic party together with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . He was also planning to run for Iranian presidency in the first presidential elections , but withdrew after Ayatollah Khomeini told a delegation of Rafsanjani and Khamenei that he prefers non - clerics as presidents , which led to Islamic Republic party 's endorsement of first Jalaleddin Farsi and then , inevitably , Abolhassan Banisadr . Beheshti died by assassination on June 28 , 1981 , when a bomb exploded during a party conference . The bomb was planted by the Mujahideen al - Khalq organization who at that time were involved in a campaign of bombings and attacks against officials of the Islamic Republic. .
