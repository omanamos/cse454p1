Antoine Houdar de la Motte ( January 18 , 1672 - December 26 , 1731 ) , was a French author . He was born and died in Paris . In 1693 his comedy , Les Originaux , was a complete failure , and so depressed the author that he contemplated joining the Trappists . Four years later he began writing operas and ballets , e.g. L'Europe galante ( 1697 ) , and tragedies , one of which , Inés de Castro ( 1723 ) , was an immense success at the Theâtre Français . He was a champion of the moderns in the revived controversy of the ancients and moderns . Madame Dacier had published ( 1699 ) a translation of the Iliad , and La Motte , who knew no Greek , made a translation ( 1714 ) in verse founded on her work . He said of his own work : " I have taken the liberty to change what I thought disagreeable in it. " . He defended the moderns in the Discours sur Homère prefixed to his translation , and in his Réfiexions sur la critique ( 1716 ) . Apart from the merits of the controversy , it was conducted on La Motte 's side with a wit and politeness which compared very favourably with his opponents methods . He was elected to the Académie française in 1710 , but soon afterwards went blind . La Motte carried on a correspondence with the duchesse du Maine , and was the friend of Fontenelle . He had the same freedom from prejudice and the same inquiring mind as the latter , and it is on the excellent prose in which his views are expressed that his reputation rests . His Œuvres du theâtre ( 2 vols. ) appeared in 1730 , and his Œuvres ( 10 vols. ) in 1754 . See Hippolyte Rigault , Histoire de la querelle des anciens et des modernes ( 1859 ) .
