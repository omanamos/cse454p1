Alan Alexander Milne ( IPA pronunciation : ) ( January 18 , 1882 â€“ January 31 , 1956 ) , also known as A. A. Milne , was an English author , best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie - the - Pooh and for various children 's poems . Milne was a noted writer , primarily as a playwright , before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work . Milne was born in Hampstead , London , England and grew up at Henley House School , 6 / 7 Mortimer Road , Kilburn , London , a small independent school run by his father , John V. Milne . One of his teachers was H. G. Wells . He attended Westminster School and Trinity College , Cambridge where he studied on a mathematics scholarship . While there , he edited and wrote for Granta , a student magazine . He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM . Milne 's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch , where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor . Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Warwickshire Regiment and later , after a debilitating illness , the Royal Corps of Signals . After the war , he wrote a denunciation of war titled Peace with Honour ( 1934 ) , which he retracted somewhat with 1940 's War with Honour . During World War II , Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English comic writer P.G. Wodehouse , who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year . Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment , which were broadcast from Berlin . Although the lighthearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans , Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country 's enemy . During World War II , he was Captain of the Home Guard in Hartfield & Forest Row , insisting on being plain ' Mr Milne ' to the members of his platoon . Milne married Dorothy ( nicknamed " Daphne " ) de Selincourt in 1913 , and their only son , Christopher Robin Milne , was born in 1920 . In 1925 , A. A. Milne bought a country home , Cotchford Farm , in Hartfield , East Sussex . He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid . Cotchford Farm was where the Rolling Stones ' lead guitarist Brian Jones would later live and be found drowned in 1969 . Cotchford Farm has since been demolished , due to the excessive maintenance and repair costs , and a new house built on the site . Milne is most famous for his Pooh books about a boy named Christopher Robin , after his son , and various characters inspired by his son 's stuffed animals , most notably the bear named Winnie - the - Pooh . The source of the name is reputedly a Canadian black bear named Winnipeg Bear ( after Winnipeg ) , that was used as a military mascot by the Royal Winnipeg Rifles , a Canadian Infantry Regiment in World War I , and left to London Zoo after the war . After its heroics On September 14 1915 , the bear was named ' Winnie the Pooh ' , years before Milne adopted it
