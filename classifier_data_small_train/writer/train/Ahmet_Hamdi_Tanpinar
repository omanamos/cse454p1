Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar ( 23 June 1901 - 24 January 1962 ) was one of the most important modern novelists and essayists of Turkish literature . He was also a member of the Turkish parliament ( the Grand National Assembly of Turkey ) between 1942 and 1946 . Tanpınar was born in Istanbul on the 23rd of June 1901 . His father was a judge , Hüseyin Fikri Efendi . Tanpınar 's mother died at Mosul , when Tanpınar was thirteen . Because his fathers vocation required frequent relocaton , Tanpınar continued his education in several different cities , including Istanbul , Sinop , Siirt , Kirkuk , and Antalya . After quitting veterinary college , he resumed his educational career at the Faculty of Literature at Istanbul University , which he completed in 1923 . As a literature teacher , he taught at high schools in Erzurum ( 1923 - 1924 ) , Konya , Ankara , the Educational Institute of Gazi and the Fine Arts Academy . At the Fine Arts Academy , besides teaching literature , Tanpınar taught in branches of aesthetics in arts , history of art and mythology ( 1932 - 1939 ) . From 1942 to 1946 , he entered the Turkish National Assembly as parliamentar of Kahramanmaraş . In 1953 , he made an extensive journey to Europe , traveling many countries within six months such as France , Belgium , Holland , England , Spain and Italy . Tanpınar died of a heart attack on the 24th of January 1962 in Istanbul . His grave is in the Aşiyan Graveyard , Istanbul . One of his most significant works , among others , is a novel entitled " The Time Regulation Institute " ( Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü ) ( 2002 English paperback edition : ISBN 1 - 892381 - 03 - 6 ) . The book has been widely acclaimed as an ironic criticism of the bureaucratization process with the implication that its title suggests , though that 's not what the book is all about . In fact , the book can be read from quite different perspectives , and cannot be exhausted in only one . First of all , it is a great psychological analysis of a man who suffers from being unable to adapt himself to his time , in other words to modern times . So the fact of bureaucratization is indeed incorporated into a broader problem : modernization and its impact on the individual . Most of the characters of the novel seem to be struggling in quite weird manners in order to survive in modern times . In this way , the concept of " time " occupies a central place , giving a deeper sense , even a philosophical taste to the novel .
