Bryce John Stevens ( born 1957 in Christchurch , New Zealand ) is a long - term Australian resident and horror writer / artist . At age 22 he came to Sydney to see what Australia was like and lived in a flat at Bondi where he bought the landladyâ€™s old typewriter for $5. As an artist doing much drawing , he eventually held four gallery exhibitions between NZ , Melbourne and Sydney . Titles that he gave the illustrations would sometimes turn into paragraphs , which is where he began his fiction - writing career . After Bondi he returned to NZ and trained as a psych nurse . He has also worked as an abbattoir assistant , builder 's labourer , museum attendant and kitchenhand . Between 1987 and 1992 he co - edited , ( with Chris G.C. Sequeira and Leigh Blackmore ) , Terror Australis : The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine . In the mid - 1990s he moved to Melbourne where he was a key figure ( with Steven Proposch and Chris A. Masters ) in the Melbourne Horror Society , helped produce Bloodsongs magazine , and edited many issues of Severed Head . In 1999 he held his solo art show , the " Screw the Millennium Bug Exhibition " . He produced several issues of a personal zine , Choking Dog Gazette . Stevens has published several collections of horror stories . His short stories have also appeared in Black Moon , Bloodsongs , Cold Cuts , Dead By Dawn , E.O.D , Forbidden Tomes , Cthulhu and the Co - Eds : Kids & Squids , Misanthrope , Octavia , Outside , and Terror Australis . Stevens is noted for his hard - edged and uncompromising horror content ; however he often delves into black humour and his most reprinted story is a Lovecraftian parody called " The Diary of Howard Clark Long Phillips " .
