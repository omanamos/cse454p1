Sir Arthur Charles Clarke ( born 16 December 1917 ) is a British science - fiction author and inventor , most famous for his novel 2001 : A Space Odyssey , and for collaborating with director Stanley Kubrick on the film of the same name . Clarke is the last surviving member of what was sometimes known as the " Big Three " of science fiction , which included Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov . Clarke was born in Minehead , Somerset , England , and as a boy enjoyed stargazing and enthusiastically read old American science - fiction magazines ( pulp magazines , many of which made their way to England in ships with sailors who read them to pass the time ) . After secondary school , and studying at Huish Grammar School , Taunton he was unable to afford a university education and got a job as an auditor in the pensions section of the Board of Education . During the Second World War , he served in the Royal Air Force as a radar specialist and was involved in the early warning radar defence system which contributed to the RAF 's success during the Battle of Britain . Clarke actually spent most of his service time working on the Ground Controlled Approach ( GCA ) radar , as documented in his semi - autobiographical novel Glide Path . GCA did not see much practical use in WW - II , but after several more years of development , it was vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948 - 49 . He was demobilised with the rank of Flight Lieutenant . After the war , he earned a first - class degree in mathematics and physics at King 's College London . In the postwar years Clarke became involved with the British Interplanetary Society and served for a time as its chairman . His most important contribution may be the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays . He was the first in the world to propose this in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the BIS in 1945 . The concept was later published in Wireless World in October of that year . Clarke has also written a number of non - fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight . The most notable of these may be The Exploration of Space ( 1951 ) and The Promise of Space ( 1968 ) . In recognition of this a geostationary orbit is sometimes called a ' Clarke ' orbit . While Clarke had a few stories that appeared in fanzines between 1937 and 1945 , his first professional sales appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in 1946 : " Loophole " was published in April , and " Rescue Party " , which was his first sale , was published in May . Along with his writing , Clarke worked briefly as Assistant Editor of Science Abstracts ( 1949 ) before devoting himself to writing full - time from 1951 . Clarke also contributed to the Dan Dare series , and his first three published novels were for a juvenile audience . In 1948 , he wrote " The Sentinel " for a BBC competition . Though the story was rejected , it changed the course of Clarke 's career . Not only the basis for 2001 , The Sentinel introduced a more mystical and cosmic element to Clarke 's work . Many of Clarke 's later works feature a technologically advanced but prejudiced
