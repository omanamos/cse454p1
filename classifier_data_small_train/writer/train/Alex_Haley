He enlisted as a mess - boy and then became a third class Petty Officer in the rate of Mess Attendant , one of the few enlisted designators open to African Americans at that time . It was during his service in the Pacific theater of operations that Haley taught himself the craft of writing stories . He talked of how the greatest enemy he and his crew faced during their long sea voyages was n't the Japanese but boredom . He collected many rejection slips over an eight - year period before his first story was bought . After World War II , Haley was able to petition the Coast Guard to allow him to transfer into the field of journalism , and by 1949 he had become a First Class Petty Officer in the rate of Journalist .

Haley conducted the first Playboy interview for Playboy magazine . The interview , with jazz legend Miles Davis , appeared in the September 1962 issue . In the interview , Davis candidly spoke about his thoughts and feelings on racism and it was that interview that set the tone for what would become a significant part of the magazine . Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's Playboy Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication .
