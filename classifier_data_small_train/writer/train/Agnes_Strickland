Agnes Strickland ( 19 August , 1796 â€“ 8 July , 1874 ) was an English historical writer . The daughter of Thomas Strickland of Reydon Hall , Suffolk , Agnes was educated by her father , and began her literary career with a poem , Worcester Field , followed by The Seven Ages of Woman and Demetrius . Abandoning poetry , she next produced , among others , Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children ( 1833 ) , The Pilgrims of Walsingham ( 1835 ) , Tales and Stories from History ( 1836 ) . Her chief works , however , are Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest , and Lives of the Queens of Scotland , and English Princesses , etc. ( 8 vols. , 1850 - 1859 ) , Lives of the Bachelor Kings of England ( 1861 ) , and Letters of Mary Queen of Scots , in some of which she was assisted by her sister Elizabeth . Strickland 's researches were laborious and conscientious , and she remains a useful source , but she failed to exercise the level of objectivity that a modern historian would aspire to . Her style is considered mediocre , by some , but writing should be compared only directly to that of the contemporaries of the time . Most of the Strickland sisters ' historical research and writing was actually done by Elizabeth . Elizabeth however eschewed all publicity and Agnes was put forward as authoress .
