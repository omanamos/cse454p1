For A. Byatt , the director of French documentary films , see Andy Byatt . Dame Antonia Byatt , DBE ( born August 24 , 1936 , Sheffield , England ) has been hailed as one of the great postmodern novelists in Britain . She is usually known as A. S. Byatt . Antonia Susan Drabble was educated at The Mount School , York , Newnham College Cambridge , Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania , USA and Somerville College , Oxford , though her research grant to the latter institution ( dependent on single status ) ended with her marriage to Ian Byatt ( now Sir Ian Byatt ) . She lectured at London University extra - murally , the Central School of Art and Design and from 1972 to 1981 at University College London . Since becoming a full - time writer , Byatt has published several novels , most notably Possession , which won the prestigious Booker Prize in 1990 . Two of her works have been adapted into motion pictures : Possession and Angels & Insects . Also well - known for her short stories , Byatt has been influenced by Henry James and George Eliot as well as Emily Dickinson , T. S. Eliot , and Robert Browning , in merging realism and naturalism with fantasy . In her quartet of novels about mid - century England , she is clearly indebted to D.H.

The Virgin in the Garden ( 1978 ) is the first book in a quartet about the members of a Yorkshire family . The story continues in Still Life ( 1985 ) , which won the PEN / Macmillan Silver Pen Award , and Babel Tower ( 1996 ) . The fourth ( and final ) novel in the quartet is A Whistling Woman ( 2002 ) . The quartet describes mid - 20th - century Britain and Frederica 's life as the quintessential bluestocking - - a woman undergraduate at Cambridge at a time when women were heavily outnumbered by men at that University , and later , a divorc√©e with a young son making a new life in London . Like Babel Tower , A Whistling Woman covers the ' 60s and dips into the utopian and revolutionary dreams of the time . The Matisse Stories , ( 1993 ) featured three stories , each describing a painting by Henri Matisse that inspired Byatt , each the tale of an initially smaller crisis that shows the long - present unravelling in the protagonists ' lives . Byatt 's younger sister , Margaret Drabble , is also a successful novelist , and the rivalry between the two is legendary , although of uncertain origin . It has been
