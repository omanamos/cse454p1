Anne Carson is a Canadian poet , essayist , and translator , as well as a professor of Classics and comparative literature at the University of Michigan . For many years she lived in Montreal and taught at McGill University . Reticent about her private life , the biography published in current editions of her books reads , simply , " Anne Carson lives in Canada. " . Though distinguished , Carson 's academic training did not run a straight path . The fascination with classical literature which dominates her work began to take root in high school . There , a Latin instructor offered to initate her into the world and language of Ancient Greece and tutored the future poet privately . Enrolling at St. Michael 's College at the University of Toronto , she left twice - - at the end of her first and second years . Carson , disconcerted by curricular constraints ( particularly by a required course on Milton ) , defected to the world of graphic arts for a short time . She did eventually return to the University of Toronto where she completed her B.A. in 1974 , her M.A. in 1975 and her Ph.D. in 1981 . A professor of the classics , with background in classical languages , comparative literature , anthropology , history , and commercial art , Carson blends ideas and themes from many fields in her writing . She frequently references , modernizes , and translates Greek mythology . She has published ten books as of 2006 , all of which blend the forms of poetry , essay , prose , criticism , translation , dramatic dialogue , fiction , and non - fiction .
