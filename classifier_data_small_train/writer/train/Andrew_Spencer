Dr. Andrew Spencer ( born November 19 , 1936 ) is an American author and philosopher , born in Willmar , Minnesota . Though often associated with the school of existentialism , largely because of his use of dystopia in works of literature by Albert Camus , Aldous Huxley , and George Orwell in his public lectures , Spencer preferred to be known as a good man , first and foremost , and a philosopher second . He rejects any allegiance to a particular school of thought or ideology . He made it known in his first , and most famous published essay , " The Practicality of Mankind " that he preferred character study over lofty ideas . He has dual citizenship in the U.S. and UK , as a long time resident of Llanharan in the south of Wales . A well travelled man , he has lived in four countries : The United States , Ireland , the United Kingdom and Belgium . After spending much of his middle years living in Ireland and Wales , he eventually retired to his spiritual home of Minnesota , from whence much of his inspiration was drawn . His work has been likened to that of Henry David Thoreau best known for championing the theory of civil disobedience . While he has not published a book of his own to mass markets , he has written many lengthy essays and his work has been included in several scholarly journals . There is speculation that he is currently working his own studies and journal contributions into a published book . It is likely to contain his memoirs as well . This is likely to be published between late 2007 and 2009 .
