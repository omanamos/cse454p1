Alexander Lange Kielland ( IPA : ɑlɛksɑndər ˈlɑŋːə ˈçɛlːɑn ) ( February 18 , 1849 – April 6 , 1906 ) was one of the most famous Norwegian authors of the 19th century . Born in Stavanger , Norway , he grew up in a rich merchant family . Even though he was born rich he had a sincere affection for the less fortunate . And he treated his workers well when he was a factory owner . He remained a spokesman for the weak and a critic of society throughout his time as a writer . Among his most famous works are the novels Garman & Worse ( 1880 ) , Skipper Worse ( 1882 ) , and Poison ( Gift , 1883 ) . His short stories are also well known . In Gift ( Poison , 1883 ) Kielland debates the hunger for Latin which Norwegian teachers had in this area of time . The story has its peak when a young boy called Marius , is lying on his deathbed , repeating Latin grammar . It has been debated why Kielland ended his career as a writer so early . Some believe that he was so much of a realist that he could not deal with new - romantic tendencies in Norwegian literature at the end of the 19th century . A more probable reason is that he chose to focus on his politic career . Tor Obrestad 's biography of Alexander L. Kielland opens up thoughts about Kielland dying from obesity . He had several heart - attacks , he constantly gained weight and he could n't control his great passion for food . From 1891 he was the Mayor of his hometown , Stavanger . In 1902 he was designated county governor of Møre og Romsdal . He is one of the so - called " The Four Greats " in Norwegian literature , along with Henrik Ibsen , Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson , and Jonas Lie .
