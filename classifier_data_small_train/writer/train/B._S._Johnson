Johnson ( Bryan Stanley Johnson ) ( 5 February , 1933 - 13 November , 1973 ) was an English experimental novelist , poet , literary critic and film - maker . Johnson was born into a working class family , was evacuated from London during World War II and left school at sixteen to work as an accountant . However , he taught himself Latin in the evenings , and with this knowledge , managed to pass the university exam for King 's College London . After he graduated with a 2:2 , Johnson wrote a series of increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels . Johnson also made numerous experimental films , published poetry , and wrote reviews , short stories and plays . A critically acclaimed film adaptation of the last of the novels published while he was alive , Christie Malry 's Own Double - Entry ( 1973 ) was released in 2000 . At the age of 40 , increasingly depressed by his failure to succeed commercially , and beset by family problems , Johnson committed suicide . Johnson was largely unknown to the wider reading public at the time of his death , but has a growing cult following . Jonathan Coe 's 2004 biography " Like a Fiery Elephant " ( winner of the 2005 Samuel Johnson prize ) has already led to a renewal of interest in Johnson 's work . The 2006 album called Live a Little by The Pernice Brothers includes a song called B.S. Johnson about the writer . The chorus includes the line " Jammed into a plot where you never would fit. " .
