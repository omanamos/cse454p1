Charles de Lint ( born December 22 , 1951 ) is a Canadian fantasy author and Celtic folk musician . It is often said that , along with Terri Windling , he established the genre of mythic fiction which falls somewhere between fantasy literature , and mainstream fiction with a magical realist bent . This is debatable , as John Crowley preceded de Lint with the novel " Little , Big " , which was published in 1981 , and won the World Fantasy Award the following year for its blending of classical fantasy with modern culture . In any case , de Lint can certainly be credited with popularizing the emerging genre , which is also known as " urban myth " or " urban fantasy. " . De Lint 's work has been called " fantasy for people who normally do n't read fantasy. " . He was born in Bussum , the Netherlands , and emigrated to Canada at the age of four months . He now lives in Ottawa . He published three novels under the pseudonym Samuel M. Key which have subsequently been reprinted by Orb Books as Charles de Lint . Many of his later stories center around the mythical North American city of Newford and a regular cast of characters that make cameo and feature appearances . He has received many awards including the 2000 World Fantasy Award for Best Collection for Moonlight and Vines . He has also published a children 's book , Circle of Cats , with artist Charles Vess . In addition to being the author of numerous novels and short stories , de Lint is also a poet , musician , artist , folklorist , and critic . His poetry can be found online in The Endicott Studio Journal of Mythic Arts . De Lint also scripted several comic books for Barry Blair 's Aircel Publishing in the mid - 1980s .
