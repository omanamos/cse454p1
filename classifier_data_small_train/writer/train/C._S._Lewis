Clive Staples Lewis ( 29 November 1898 – 22 November 1963 ) , commonly referred to as C. S. Lewis , was an Irish author and scholar . Lewis is known for his work on medieval literature , Christian apologetics , literary criticism and fiction . He is best known today for his series The Chronicles of Narnia . Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien , the author of The Lord of the Rings . Both authors were leading figures in the English faculty at Oxford University and in the informal Oxford literary group known as the " Inklings " . Due in part to Tolkien 's influence , Lewis converted to Christianity , becoming " a very ordinary layman of the Church of England " ( Lewis 1952 , p. 6 ) . His conversion had a profound effect on his work , and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim . Late in life he married the American writer Joy Gresham , who died of bone cancer four years later at the age of 45 . Lewis 's works have been translated into over 30 languages and continue to sell over a million copies a year ; the books that comprise The Chronicles of Narnia have sold over 100 million copies . A number of stage and screen adaptations of Lewis 's works have also been produced , the most notable of which is the 2005 Disney film adaptation of The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast , Ireland ( now the capital of Northern Ireland ) on November 29 1898 . His father was Albert James Lewis ( 1863–1929 ) , a solicitor whose father , Richard , had come to Ireland from Wales . His mother was Flora Augusta Lewis née Hamilton ( 1862–1908 ) , the daughter of a Church of Ireland minister . He had one older brother , Warren Hamilton Lewis ( Warnie ) . At the age of four , shortly after his dog Jacksie was hit by a car , Lewis announced that his name was now Jacksie . At first he would answer to no other name , but later accepted Jacks which became Jack , the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life . At six his family moved into " Little Lea " , the house the elder Mr. Lewis built for Mrs. Lewis , in Strandtown , Northern Ireland . Lewis was initially schooled by private tutors before being sent to the Wynyard School in Watford , Hertfordshire , in 1908 , the same year that his mother died of cancer . Lewis 's brother had already enrolled there three years previously . The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils—the headmaster Robert " Oldie " Capron was soon after committed to an insane asylum . Tellingly , in Surprised By Joy , Lewis would later nickname the school " Belsen " . There is some speculation by biographer Alan Jacobs that the atmosphere at Wynyard greatly traumatized Lewis and was responsible for the development of " mildly sadomasochistic fantasies " . After Wynyard closed , Lewis attended Campbell College in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home , but he left after a few months due to respiratory problems . As a result of his illness , Lewis was sent to the health - resort town of Malvern , Worcestershire
