C.C. Saint - Clair was born in ( insert birthdate or birth year ) of French parents in Casablanca , Morocco and majored in English literature at the University of Texas at Austin . First published in 2001 , C.C. Saint - Clair , Australian author , attracted the label of The Thinking - Woman 's Lesbian Romance Writer because of the sensually descriptive lesbian relationship issues she wove in intelligent plots focusing on the dark side of women 's lives . Though she soon let it be known that , as far as she was concerned , she did not see a direct link between that label and her writing , she did not object to it being used . She did state in an interview with Curve Magazine that the term Social Realism was much better suited as a genre descriptor of her writing . She went on to publish another 6 novels , including the very endearing Far From Maddy . C.C. Saint - Clair’s other best known novel is Morgan in the Mirror . Written in 2004 , at a time when FTM transgenderism was viewed as a rather obscure and kinky condition bordering on the freakish , it was for many lesbians the first novel they read that dealt with the topic of female - to - male transgenderism . Most who read it agreed that Saint - Clair 's novel had opened up their eyes / mind / hearts to the issue and went a long way into demystifying it . Morgan in the mirror was quickly accepted by the established activists of the FTM movement - FTM international http : / / www.ftmi.org and personal websites http : / / www.thetransitionalmale.com / look . Morgan in the Mirror was also discussed on Gender Talk http : / / www.gendertalk.com / real / 500 / gt522.shtml in a lively interview with Saint - Clair hosted by Nancy Nangeroni & Gordene O. MacKenzie . Some individuals belonging to the new brand of FTM militants flamed Saint - Clair’s novel on the grounds that , as a non - member of the FTM community , she had no right to write creatively about a fictitious FTM’s journey . C.C.Saint - Clair went on to adapt both Far From Maddy and Morgan in the Mirror to screenplays . Both have won awards as scripts , however none that have so far lead to either being optioned . More recently , Saint - Clair published a series of short stories , such as The Whip - Hand – an erotic plot with a strong BDSM slant - and The Fish - Whispered and The Crab - Catcher , a metaphoric tale of the theme of sexual awakening . They are showcased on Amazon.com 's Shorts / http : / / www.amazon.com / Crab - Catcher - Fish - Whisperer / dp / B000FIMIOS / ref=sr_1_5 / 103 - 9684167 - 5177418 ? ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180143270&sr=1 -
