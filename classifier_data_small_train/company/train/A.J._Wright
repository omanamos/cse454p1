A.J. Wright is a chain of approximately 152 American retail / outlet stores established in 1998 and owned by TJX Companies . Like its sister company T.J. Maxx , A.J. Wright sells clothing , domestics , giftware , footwear , accessories , and fragrances at prices between twenty and seventy percent below regular prices . A.J. Wright differs from other TJX chains by refreshing its merchandise on a regular basis . For most stores , new shipments arrive every weekday . Although A.J. Wright 's primary target market is moderate - income families , its recent expansion has drawn additional consumer groups . The company 's community service strategy centers on monetary donations to the Boys and Girls Club of America and other affiliates . A.J. Wright opened its first six stores in the northeastern region of the United States in the fall of 1998 . The first three stores — located in the towns of Brockton , Somerville , and Malden , Massachusetts — were opened simultaneously on September 20 of that year . During the initial openings , Johnson & Wales University 's marketing director , Mark Neckes , approved of A.J. Wright ; he stated that A.J. Wright strengthens TJX 's coverage of urban markets , an area " where people need a place to shop a place where retailers understand what people are looking for " . A.J. Wright continued to open new stores as its customer base increased . By 2000 , A.J. Wright operated 25 stores across the United States ; by December 2001 , the number had increased to 40 . The chain opened an additional 112 stores by the end of 2005 , bringing its total to 152 ; however , this number will fluctuate due to store closures . In 2006 , one business article stated that A.J. Wright was " in the red " and that TJX needed to " figure out the future of its newer divisions , the less profitable A.J. Wright and HomeGoods stores and the non - off - price Bob’s Stores " . Therefore , the company chose to focus on lowering the rapid expansion of the chain . On November 30 , 2006 , TJX announced the closure of 34 underproducing stores . According to a TJX 10 - Q on December 1 , 2006 , the closures were determined by " several factors , including market demographics and proximity to other A.J. Wright stores , cash return , sales volume and productivity , recent comparable store sales and profit trends , and overall market performance " . Employees were provided with severance packages or offers to transfer to other A.J. Wright or TJX stores . In our ongoing pursuit to drive profitable sales , we have made a strategic decision that we believe makes A.J. Wright a stronger business and puts it in a substantially better position for future growth . The tentative closure date for the stores was January 27 , 2007 . Because of closing expenses , TJX expected to include a reduction of $37 million in their fourth quarter 2006 net income statement . On February 21 , 2007 , TJX reported that the net income had fallen from $288.7 million the previous year to $205.5 million ; the reduction included the $37 million closing expenses . The company expects to open approximately ten new stores by 2008 . During this period , the TJX database was hacked and customer information was compromised . Although TJX originally stated that the security breach occurred between May 2006 and January 2007 ,
