AbeBooks ( formerly the Advanced Book Exchange ) is an online marketplace for books . Most books listed are used books , many are rare or out - of - print , and a growing number are new books .

In May 2006 , AbeBooks purchased a 40 per cent stake in LibraryThing.com - a social networking and book cataloging website for bibliophiles . AbeBooks allows users to search across the listings of many independent bookstores , thereby allowing small , independent players to compete with bookselling superstores . Some of the member bookstores offer their books online only while others also maintain a regular storefront . Booksellers upload their inventory data to the AbeBooks database , specifying information about each book including condition and price . Prices are fixed ( with US$1 being the minimum ) and there are no auctions . Items available range from the extremely common , where there might be hundreds of copies listed , to truly unique manuscript material worth thousands of dollars . In addition to books ; magazines , audio books , journals , illustration art , vintage photographs , and paper ephemera are offered . Sellers can , within limits , set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers . Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site 's interface . Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller 's location . Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers . Listings originating on any of AbeBooks ' sites are combined with all . While AbeBooks is arguably the largest such site , some booksellers who list on AbeBooks also list their books on multiple competing marketplaces such as Alibris , Biblio.com , and Amazon.com .
