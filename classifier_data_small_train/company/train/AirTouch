AirTouch Communications was a U.S . - based wireless service provider that was created when PacTel Cellular was spun off from Pacific Telesis on April 1 , 1994 , forming both AirTouch Cellular and AirTouch Paging . On June 30 , 1999 , AirTouch Communications merged with UK - based Vodafone Group Plc , and the new company was called Vodafone AirTouch Plc . In September 1999 , Vodafone AirTouch announced a $70 - billion joint venture with Bell Atlantic Corp. to be called Verizon Wireless , and which would be comprised of the two companies ' U.S. wireless assets : Bell Atlantic Mobile , AirTouch Cellular , PrimeCo Communications , and AirTouch Paging . This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months , and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4 , 2000 . On June 30 , 2000 , the addition of GTE Wireless ' assets , in connection with the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE to form Verizon Communications , made Verizon Wireless the nation 's largest wireless communications provider ( until Cingular 's acquisition of AT&T Wireless in 2004 ) . For the joint venture , Verizon Communications owns 55 % and UK - based Vodafone Group ( formerly Vodafone AirTouch ) owns 45 % . US West started its own wireless company in the early 1980s and branded it as US West New Vectorâ€”one of the first providers of personal wireless services at the time . However , due to federal regulations in place , they were not allowed to combine the sales of cellular and paging service with their wireline telephone service . Eventually through growth and a series of acquisitions , US West Cellular ( formerly US West New Vector ) and AirTouch Communications had both grown large in size and range . It was determined that both companies should merge . Due to regulatory limitations , certain overlapping areas of coverage had to be re - spun off , traded , or sold to other wireless providers . Much of this went to GTE Wireless , which was added to Verizon Wireless on June 30 , 2000 . In some areas , the US West Cellular name was kept in place , giving the false appearance that the two were separate companies . However , in 1996 , US West Cellular ceased to exist and all accounts were converted to AirTouch by the end of 1997 . The former US West Cellular relocated significant portions of its operations to two of the AirTouch cities of operation , Walnut Creek and San Francisco , California , from the Eastgate area of Bellevue , Washington . It was not until after deregulation that US West Communications formed another wireless company , simply called US West Wireless , which was absorbed by Qwest Communications when it took over US West . Qwest Wireless is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator ( MVNO ) that operates on Sprint PCS 's CDMA network . Verizon Wireless still maintains a call center in some of the buildings that used to house AirTouch Cellular 's call center and administrative offices . AirTouch Communications was formed when Pacific Telesis spun off PacTel Cellular in 1994 . In July 1994 , AirTouch Communications and US West formed a joint venture to eventually merge their cellular operations . In May 1996 , US West New Vector Group rebranded US West Cellular as AirTouch Cellular . In April 1997 , AirTouch tried to buy US West New Vector but missed the Morris Trust filing deadline by 1 day . In
