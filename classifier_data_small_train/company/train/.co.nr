The domain www.co.nr was registered on March 30 1998 and soon after in 2001 the .co.nr free domain service started . It is an administrator and operator of the CO.NR domain name zone . Up until Sep 15 , 2003 , CO.NR offered an ad - free domain service . However , they now request that small 88 x 31 linkback ads are placed on the main ( first ) page of userâ€™s site . Premium domain service ( domains with full DNS control ) was postponed in 2005 due to some problems and abuse . During mid 2006 , .co.nr started to offer instant account activation when registering domains . The link back policy is still in place , and users of CO.NR domains are requested make sure they link back properly using the code provided . CO.NR suspends all accounts that fail to do this . Currently , CO.NR offers support to those who register a domain with them . When registering a domain , .co.nr check that all sites comply with their Terms of Service . To check that users link back they have a script which runs at random times and suspends domains without a valid linkback . When premium services are out of beta - testing , many more services like e - mail forwarding and full control over your domain name will be released . From April 7 2007 until April 9 2007 , members of the co.nr service were not able to access any sites using the .co.nr subdomain . This made many users think that the .co.nr service has closed down . All sites have now been confirmed by tech support as back online . Due to a large amount of support requests , .co.nr created support forums which are located at www.forums.co.nr . On these support forums you can get help for many things including complaints , problem solving and complimenting the .co.nr service . There are 3 admins , 4 moderators and 5 members of a team known as the " .CO.NR Forums Team " who help around the board and do general tasks . In addition , there is also a form on the main site for directly contacting tech support . For more details on this topic , see biz.ly . Although .co.nr indefinitely suspended premium domains , they offer an alternative service at Nic.Biz.Ly . This is related to the .co.nr premium domain service ( which is still under beta - testing ) . CO.NR Forums - support and community . CO.NR Directory - a free directory that allows only the submission of co.nr websites . CO.NR Directory Blog - the blog of the co.nr directory .
