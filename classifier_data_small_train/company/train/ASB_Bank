ASB is one of New Zealand 's largest banks , with branches throughout the country . It also has insurance and securities arms . ASB also operates BankDirect , a branchless banking service that provides service via phone , Internet , eftpos and ATMs only . ASB began in 1847 as the Auckland Savings Bank . During the 1980s the association of savings banks amalgamated the local savings banks throughout New Zealand with ASB at their head , and adopted the name ASB Trust Bank - a name which suffers from RAS syndrome . In 1986 , ASB withdrew from the Trust Bank and in 1987 became a fully - fledged commercial bank simply to be known as ASB Bank . In 1988 , the Government passed the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act , which enabled ASB to become a public company . In 1989 , the ASB Bank Community Trust , the owner of the bank , sold 75 per cent of the shares to Commonwealth Bank . In 1994 , ASB amalgamated Westland Bank , its wholly owned subsidiary , which enabled it to operate on a truly national basis . In 1999 , ASB Group acquired Sovereign Limited , a life insurance company , and the retail stockbroking and fixed income operations of Warburg Dillon Read . In 2000 , Commonwealth Bank bought the remaining 25 per cent of ASB 's shares from the Trust . In 2005 the ASB Bank brand was changed to ASB to reflect the more integrated financial services provider that they had become . The bank has had a series of successful commercials with the Ira Goldstein character .
