Aerotec was founded in Brazil in 1962 under the auspices of the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology ( CTA ) in Sao Jose dos Campos . Beginning in the late 1960s , the firm manufactured a two - seat trainer for the Brazilian Air Force , the Aerotec Uirapuru . A small number were also built for the civil market , and still others were exported to other Latin American countries . By 1980 , Aerotec 's main business was producing components for Embraer . However , around this time , the Air Force became interested in an uprated version of the now - venerable Uirapuru . A prototype was built ( designated Uirapuru II ) but by the time it flew , the Air Force no longer required it . A small number were built for export . In 1987 , the firm was sold to Embraer .
