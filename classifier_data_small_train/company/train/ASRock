ASRock Incorporation produces motherboards , mainly for the lower - budget sector . It was started in 2002 in Taiwan as a subsidiary of ASUS . In the beginning , they were mainly known for producing cheap OEM solutions based on low - cost outdated chipsets . These turned out to be quite successful because of their price and reliability . Since then ASRock has evolved into producing creative value - oriented solutions , often with an eye on multiple compatibility . They have been producing motherboards with both Socket 478 and Socket LGA775 support , with both Socket 754 and Socket 939 support , with both AGP and PCI Express support , as well as boards with Future CPU Ports that allow the installation of a card with a future CPU socket and memory interface on it . The ASRock Graphics Interface ( AGI ) is a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port ( AGP ) standard . Its purpose is to provide AGP - support for those of Asrock 's motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP - support , in many cases allowing both AGP and PCI - Express support on a single motherboard . However , it 's not fully compatible and several videocard chipsets are known to not be supported . The AGI therefore is of somewhat limited use and is only used on very low - end motherboards . Currently ASRock is popular for its cheap Core 2 Duo Socket 775 motherboards .
