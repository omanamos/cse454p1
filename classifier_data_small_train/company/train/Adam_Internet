Adam Internet , South Australia 's oldest ISP grew out of the original bulletin board system of the Adelaide Amiga User Group ( ADAM - ADelaide AMiga ) . The bulletin board was setup in 1987 and was originally run by the user group , but was co - opted by its SysOp , Greg Hicks . In 1989 it transformed into a commercial multi - line TBBS - based bulletin board , which in its time was reportedly the biggest in the southern hemisphere , and for many years was the most popular in Adelaide , with 64 lines was also the largest BBS in Australia . In the early 1990s Adam BBS added Internet access as an additional option , becoming the first commercial ISP in South Australia in the process . Access was via a gateway from the BBS - one logged into the BBS as normal , and then selected an ' Internet ' option from the main menu . One could then log into their internet account , and if desired use SLIP to establish a direct IP connection . Today Adam functions primarily as an Internet Service Provider and are currently rolling out their own ADSL2 + network through selected exchanges in South Australia . This enabled the company to offer high speed broadband ; up to 24 Mbit / s ; Internet access independently of Telstra 's DSLAMs . Adam also runs a host of gaming and file servers ; its gaming network GamingSA is one of the largest in the state . FileArena - Adam 's file mirror ; hosts a variety of files including mirrors for several large Linux distributions such as Ubuntu , Suse and Fedora , as well as a Tucows Mirror .
