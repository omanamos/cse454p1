AllerAir Industries , founded in 1996 , manufactures air purifiers for homes and offices as well as for industrial , medical , commercial and military applications . One of AllerAir 's founding goals is to create air purifiers that are as inert as possible . In the context of air purification , an inert machine is one whose components release no chemicals into the air . This over - arching goal grows from the fact that a family member of one of the company founders suffers from chemical sensitivities . AllerAir purifiers use HEPA filters to remove particles , activated carbon to adsorb odors and gases , and ultraviolet light for its properties of microbial sterilization . The company differentiates itself from its competitors by creating specific products for specific problems , such as its air purifiers designed for Multiple Chemical Sensitivity ( MCS ) and another for Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) . Brighter Minds. " is a fundraiser created by AllerAir to help schools improve their indoor air quality . AllerAir Industries has recently been featured in the business section of the Montreal Gazette . In December 2005 , High Times magazine independently reviewed their air purifier for tobacco smoke .
