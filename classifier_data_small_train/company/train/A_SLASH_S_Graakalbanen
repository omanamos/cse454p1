A / S Graakalbanen was a private company that built and operated the tramway Gråkallbanen in Trondheim , Norway between 1924 and 1971 , when it was merged with Trondheim Sporvei . The company was established in 1916 with the purpose to build a tramway from the city center via the new residential areas of Byåsen to the recreational areas of Bymarka and the mountain Gråkallen . Work on the line started in 1917 and in 1924 the tramway opened to Munkvoll , with expansions to Ugla in 1925 and Lian , the final terminus in 1933 . The last stretch was financed through a separate company A / S Ugla - Lian , that finance the track and got 5 øre per ticket until that company was bought by A / S Graakalbanen . In the city the company rented track from the city trams on Ilalinjen between Ila and the companies terminus at St. Olav 's Gate . In 1966 the City of Trondheim bought the company and merged it with the municipally owned tram company Trondheim Sporvei in 1971 , that merged with Trondheim Bilruter to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap in 1974 . Today this company is part of Team Trafikk , a subsidiary of Nettbuss . In 1990 , two years after the closure of the Trondheim Tramway , a new private company called Gråkallbanen AS started operating Gråkallbanen .
