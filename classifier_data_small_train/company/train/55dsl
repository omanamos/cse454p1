55DSL is a company founded in Italy in 1994 which sells male and female clothing all around the world . In the beginning 55DSL was an experimental line for Diesel . Its first collection was called ' FW94 , Subzero Winter ' - a male collection comprising of 55 pieces in total . After 5 years operating under Diesel , the brand became an independent business unit , and moved from Italy to Balerna in Switzerland . Here it stayed for six years ( until 2005 ) , when it moved back again to Italy . 55DSL is a bridging brand between urban culture and fashion . The core market for the brand is late teens and twenty - something urban guys and girls . According to the brand website , the brand is there to appeal to fashion - minded , young people , interested or involved in active sports , who have a DIY attitude . The brand takes its name from the number of pieces in the original collection ( 55 ) followed somewhat mysteriously by the first letters of the words deep , silent , and lethal . The company 's mission ( as stated on the company website ) is to " become the most famous fashion option in street - wear " .
