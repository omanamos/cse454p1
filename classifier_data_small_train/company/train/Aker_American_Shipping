Aker American Shipping ( OSE : AKASA ) is a Norwegian - American shipping and shipyard company and part of the Aker Group , with Aker ASA owning 53.4 % of the company . The company is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and is headquartered in Oslo , Norway . Aker American Shipping consists of the shipyard , Aker Philadelphia Shipyard , and the shipping company , American Shipping Corporation ( ASC ) . Aker American Shipping builds merchant vessels for companies operating under the Jones Act and , through its subsidiaries , owns and leases those ships as well . The Jones Act requires all water transport between US ports to be operated by US flag ships and requires US flag ships to be built in US shipyards , owned by US citizens , and operated by an American crew . Aker Philadelphia Shipyard , originally Kværner Philadelphia Shipyard , began as a product of a partnership of public and private investments used to rebuild and convert 110 acres of the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , which was closed in 1995 . After the acquisition of Kværner , Aker took ownership of the yard . In 2006 , Aker Philadelphia Shipyard delivered the final vessel in a four - ship series of containerships to Matson Navigation Company . With that , the yard transitioned to building a series of Veteran Class MT46 double - hulled product tankers for bareboat charter to Overseas Shipholding Group , Inc. , a build program that extends into 2012 .
