Acme Whistles is the one and only trademark product of the J. Hudson Co. Ltd. Acme is the world’s largest and most famous producer of whistles . Headquartered in the Jewellery Quarter district of Birmingham , England , their patented designs are the recognized standard in loud noise production . The name “Acme” comes from the Greek word “acme” , meaning a high point . This indicates that the whistle is a tool for producing a very high decibel level . In 1883 Joseph Hudson , a toolmaker and violinist , began tinkering in his toolshed to make gadgets to sell . One of the things he made were whistles . Prior to that time whistles had been used as musical instruments . After observing Bobbies ( British Police ) having a hard time communicating with rattles , he realized that his whistle could be used as a tool . As the story goes , Hudson accidentally dropped his violin and it shattered on the floor . After observing how the discordant sound of the strings breaking traveled , he got the idea to put a pea in the whistle . This gave it an ear splitting rattle that could grab attention up to two miles away . After a demonstration at Scotland Yard he had his first sale . The first whistle was nicknamed the “Thunderer” and the rest was history . The “Thunderer” is still Acme’s best selling brand . Today Acme sells over 5 million whistles per year . They have made over a billion whistles altogether . While most today are made of plastic , the original whistles were made from folded brass strips . In addition to the “Thunderer” , they make varieties of bird calls , dog calls , safety whistles , sports whistles , and party whoopers . The Acme Thunderer whistle makes a notable appearance on the popular album Marchin ' Already by the British rock band Ocean Colour Scene , both visibly in the album sleeve artwork , and audibly in the opening track .
