AOpen is a major electronics manufacturer from Taiwan that makes computers and parts for computers , including motherboards , optical disk drives , and input devices as a subsidiary of Acer . They are perhaps most well known for their " Mobile on Desktop " ( MoDT ) solutions , which implements Intel 's Pentium M platform on desktop motherboards . Because the Pentium 4 and other Netburst CPUs proved less energy efficient than the Pentium M , in late 2004 and early 2005 , many manufacturers introduced desktop motherboards for the mobile Pentium M , AOpen being one of the first to offer such solutions . Critics have called the miniPC 's design unoriginal , some have even gone as far as calling the miniPC a blatant rip - off of the Mac mini , especially since the miniPC was announced after the Mac mini ( Mac mini : early 2005 , miniPC : late 2005 ) . However , AOpen 's technical support staff claims , as of a 2005 November posting on AOpen 's support forum , " AOpen has spent almost 2 years developing and marketing the miniPC . The concept came much earlier than the Mac mini " ( translated from the original Chinese ) . Apple has not sued AOpen over the miniPC design , as many critics predicted . AOpen 's miniPC product page is very similar in both design and layout to Apple 's product pages . As of 2006 March , AOpen has released a redesigned second - generation miniPC .
