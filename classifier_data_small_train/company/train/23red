It maintains offices off Oxford Street in central London and in Nottingham . 23red’s core focus lies in brand advertising , branded content , relationship marketing and brand activation . By October 2000 , the dot - com boom fuelled an explosion of start - ups and mergers of agencies delivering marketing , advertising and digital services throughout the UK . As a result , new companies promising highly creative , interactive solutions rose to challenge existing market leaders . Tequila Payne Stracey , a London - based direct marketing agency , had grown from a modest five employees in 1991 to more than 300 in 2000 . Looking to build a more nimble agency suitable for competing in an emerging , dynamic landscape , Tequila’s Chief Executive Jane Asscher , Managing Director Adam Wylie and Creative Director Sean Kinmont left the business in October 2000 to start a new agency 23red .
