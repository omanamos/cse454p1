A.T. Kearney is an international management consulting firm , dating its origins back to the early days of the management consulting profession . A.T. Kearney was founded Andrew Thomas Kearney , the former first partner of McKinsey of McKinsey & Company , founded in 1926 . McKinsey & Company was one of the first large organized consulting firms . Prior to the establishment of McKinsey & Company , consultants usually worked solo or in small teams . In 1939 , A.T. Kearney left McKinsey & Company after James McKinsey died . The remaining partners ( Tom Bower and Andrew Kearney ) disagreed over how to run the firm . Kearney kept the Chicago office and created a new firm called A.T. Kearney . Tom Bower retained the name McKinsey and the rest of the McKinsey offices . The firm operated within the United States until 1964 when it opened its first international office in Düsseldorf . A.T. Kearney now has 48 offices located in major business centres in 32 countries . In 1995 EDS , a large technology consulting firm , acquired A.T. Kearney effectively transitioning the practice from a partnership model to life as a subsidiary as a publicly listed company . The rationale for the acquisition was that A.T. Kearney 's " presence in the board rooms " of major global companies would provide ' cross - sell ' synergies . A.T. Kearney’s revenues tripled in the five years after the acquisition . Initially , A.T. Kearney and EDS did pursue some technology projects ' jointly ' , such as a highly successful project with Rolls - Royce . However , over time it became clear that A.T. Kearney 's independance was compromised by such a relationship ( i.e. advising on corporate and technology strategy and providing the technology consulting services to implement ) . There were also reports The A.T. Kearney / EDS relationship soured at a senior management level over the coming years as cultural differences emerged . The technology down - turn further highlighted the difficulties of operating as a ' public company ' . While other consulting companies were able to ' absorb ' losses ( McKinsey did a capital call in order to ride out the down turn ) , the short term nature of ' the markets ' forced A.T. Kearney to aggressively downsize globally , which significantly hurt A.T. Kearney 's brand in recruitment markets ( such as Business Schools ) , as it did in other firms in A.T. Kearney 's peer group . While competing management consulting firms recovered rapidly after the economic down turn A.T. Kearney continued to under - perform . A.T. Kearney contributed less than 5 % of EDS ' total revenues in 2004 , and posted a $10 million loss . In 2005 , EDS CEO , Michael Jordan , confirmed rumours that EDS was seeking to sell A.T. Kearney back to its management team . The transaction was completed in January 2006 . More than 170 A.T. Kearney officers from 26 countries participated in the transaction as investors ( 90 % of those invited to participate did so ) . The return to private ownership was widely considered a success in the market place . A.T. Kearney 's industry specialties include Automotive , Communications , Consumer & Retail , Financial Institutions , Government , High Tech & Electronics , Pharma & Health Care , and Energy & Utilities . Major competency teams include Supply Chain Management , Growth Strategies , Mergers , Innovation & Complexity , IT Strategies , and Transformation . A.T. Kearney
