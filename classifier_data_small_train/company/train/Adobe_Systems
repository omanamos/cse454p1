Adobe Systems ( pronounced a - DOE - bee IPA : ) ( NASDAQ : ADBE ) ( LSE : ABS ) is a computer software company headquartered in San Jose , California , United States . Adobe was founded in December 1982 by John Warnock and Charles Geschke , who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to further develop and commercialize the PostScript page description language . Adobe played a significant role in sparking the desktop publishing revolution when Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in the LaserWriter printer product line in 1985 . The company name Adobe comes from the Adobe Creek , which ran behind the house of one of the company 's founders . Adobe acquired its former competitor , Macromedia , in December 2005 . As of January 2007 , Adobe Systems has 6,068 employees , about 40 % of whom work in San Jose . Adobe also has major development operations in Seattle , Washington ; San Francisco , California ; NOIDA and Bangalore in India ; and Ottawa , Canada . Minor Adobe development offices include a location near Minneapolis , Minnesota ; Newton , Massachusetts ; San Luis Obispo , California and in Hamburg , Germany . Since 2001 , Fortune magazine has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work . Adobe was rated the fifth best American company to work for in 2003 and sixth best in 2004 . Most recently it was ranked 31st in the 2007 Fortune Best Companies to Work For list . Adobe 's first products following PostScript were digital fonts beginning with their proprietary Type 1 fonts . Apple later developed TrueType fonts , a competing format which it licensed to Microsoft . TrueType had certain advantages : it provided not only full scalability , but also precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font 's outlines . A few months later Adobe published the Type 1 specification , and soon released the Adobe Type Manager software , which allowed for WYSIWYG scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen , just like TrueType ( though without the precise pixel - level control ) . However , these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType , which quickly became the standard for business and the average Windows user , with Type 1 remaining the standard in the graphics / publishing market . In 1996 , the company , in combination with Microsoft , announced the OpenType font format , and in 2003 Adobe completed the conversion of its library of Type 1 fonts to OpenType . In the mid - 1980s , soon after introducing PostScript , Adobe entered the consumer software market with Adobe Illustrator , a vector - based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh . Illustrator was the logical outgrowth of commercializing their in - house font - development software . Additionally , it helped popularize the use of PostScript - enabled laser printers . Unlike MacDraw ( then the standard Macintosh vector drawing program ) , Illustrator described all shapes with more flexible BÃ©zier curves , providing a level of accuracy not seen in other programs . Font rendering in Illustrator , however , was left to the Macintosh 's QuickDraw libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript - like approach until Adobe 's own Adobe Type Manager software was introduced . In 1989 , Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product , Adobe Photoshop for the Macintosh . Although Photoshop 1.0 had competitors , it was extremely stable and
