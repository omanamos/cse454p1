AlFikrah Couture is a clothing brand established by Alim Salahud - din and Malik Peterson . Although the founders are American , the company is based in Doha , Qatar and makes it the first international clothing label based in the Middle East . The brand focuses on fusing different cultures , art styles & backgrounds with high - end couture and applying the formula to men and women 's clothing . In 2003 , Alim Salahud - din ( born October 11th , 1983 in Philadelphia , PA ) & Malik Peterson ( born September 17th , 1982 in Detroit , MI ) met in Doha , Qatar and developed a friendship which is often attributed to their similar urban & personal backgrounds . Their shared love for fashion birthed AlFikrah Clothing in 2004 with the word ' AlFikrah ' being Arabic for " The Idea " . The duo wanted to cross their American roots with their love and devotion to the Islamic faith and it started with adding color and flare to the traditional white Thoube , which is a customary dress for Muslim men . AlFikrah Clothing was then to just design and distribute the " Thoube " but the growth of Philadelphia - based clothing company , Miskeen Originals , inspired the duo to begin producing handpainted t - shirts . AlFikrah Couture gained a strong local reputation with the t - shirts but they also claim that their initial vision of the company was lost as urban - inspired art began to drench their clothing . In an attempt to regain focus , AlFikrah Clothing was renamed to AlFikrah Couture and the label broadened its products by adding screen printed tees , denim , handbags & customized shoes .
