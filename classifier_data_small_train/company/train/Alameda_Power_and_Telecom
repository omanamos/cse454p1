Alameda Power and Telecom is a municipal utility for the city of Alameda , California . It provides electricity , cable TV and high - speed Internet services to approximately 33,000 customers . It was founded in 1887 . There have been proposals by the power producer to produce energy from waste , but not within the city of Alameda . Instead this energy would be produced at a waste transfer station located in neighboring ( and downwind ) San Leandro . Owing to the expected release of toxic emissions from what is essentially a garbage incinerator , the mayor and city council of San Leandro rejected the proposal . The mayor vowed to fight this proposal , suggesting that Alameda could instead place this near their municipal golf course . Also , unlike the three major power producers in California , as a municipal utility , Alameda is not required to establish net metering for home photovoltaic power producers , so the city currently lags far behind other communities in producing truly " green " energy , even though they have a potentially productive site for supplemental wind energy on the western edge of the former naval air station .
