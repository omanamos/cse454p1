Aigle is a French footwear and textile company founded in 1853 as the Compagnie du Caoutchouc Souple ( Flexible Rubber Co. ) in Montargis ( France ) , by American businessman Hiram Hutchinson . Hutchison had obtained a license in 1850 for fellow - American Charles Goodyear 's patented vulcanization process . He emigrated to France where he applied the new process to the production of wellington boots and then raincoats . In the 20th century the company expanded into the production of accessories for the motor industry and , from the 1950s , sports shoes . In 1967 the company , by now named Aigle , moved manufacturing to Ingrandes , near Châtellerault , on a 30 hectare site where around 10,000 pairs of shoes are produced annually . Beginning in 2000 , the company expanded into Japan and the United States . In 2006 , there were 131 stores world - wide , of which 61 in France , 14 elsewhere in Europe , and 56 in Asia . Gross sales for the 2005 fiscal year were around 120 million euros . In 2005 , majority ownership of the company was purchased by Swiss group Maus Frères .
