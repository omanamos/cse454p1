Adidas AG ( ISIN : DE0005003404 ) is a major German sports apparel manufacturer , part of the Adidas Group , consisting of Reebok sportswear company , Taylormade golf company , Maxfli golf balls , and Adidas golf and is the second largest sportswear manufacturer in the world . The company was named after its founder , Adolf ( Adi ) Dassler . Dassler started producing shoes in the 1920s in Herzogenaurach , near Nuremberg , with the help of his brother , Rudolf Dassler , who later formed rival shoe company PUMA AG . It registered as adidas AG on 18 August 1949 ( with lower - case lettering ) . The company 's clothing and shoe designs typically feature three parallel stripes , and this same motif is incorporated into Adidas 's current official logo . The company revenue for 2005 was listed at 6.6 billion euro , or about 8.4 billion U.S. dollars . Adidas revenue for 2006 was listed at 10.084 billion euro , or about 13.625 billion U.S. dollars . Adidas perfumery and personal care products are manufactured by Coty , Inc. under license worldwide . The history of the company as presented by its official web site is incomplete , perhaps because it is indirectly linked to financial scandals . After a period of serious trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler 's son Horst Dassler in 1987 , the company was bought in 1990 by French industrialist Bernard Tapie , for 1.6 billion French francs ( now €243.918 million ) , which Tapie borrowed . Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt companies , a business on which he built his fortune . Tapie decided to move production offshore to Asia . He also hired Madonna for promotion . He sent Walter Head , from Christchurch , New Zealand , a shoe sales representative , to Germany and met Adolf Dassler 's descendants and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there . In 1992 , Tapie was unable to pay the interest from his loan . He mandated the Crédit Lyonnais bank to sell Adidas , and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed into equity of the enterprise , which was unusual for then - current French banking practice . Apparently , the state - owned bank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie , reportedly because Tapie was a minister of Urban Affairs ( ministre de la Ville ) in the French government at the time . In February 1993 , Crédit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Robert Louis - Dreyfus , a friend of Bernard Tapie ( and cousin of Julia Louis - Dreyfus from the Seinfeld TV series ) , for a much higher amount of money than what Tapie owed , 4.485 billion ( €683.514 million ) francs rather than 2.85 billion ( €434.479 million ) . Tapie later sued the bank , because he felt " spoiled " by the indirect sale . Robert Louis - Dreyfus became the new CEO of the company . He is also the president of the Olympique de Marseille football team , a team Tapie owned until 1993 . Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994 . He was the object of several lawsuits , notably related to match fixing at the soccer club . He spent 6 months in La Santé prison in Paris in 1997 after being sentenced to 18 . In 2005 , French courts awarded Tapie a €135 million
