Airwalk is a boardsport ( ie . Surfing and skateboarding ) footwear company based in Altoona , Pennsylvania . It was established in 1986 by Bill Mann and George Yohn . In the late 1980s and early 1990s , the company made skate shoes , t - shirts , snowboard boots , and other products , and sponsored professional skaters including Jason Lee and Tony Hawk . In the mid - 90 's , Mann left the company . After his departure , the decision was made to " go mainstream " and focus on a more general audience rather than just creating shoes for sport enthusiasts . There was a brief rise in sales , but some people loyal to the brand found the mainstream designs questionable . After a few ownership changes , Airwalk finally found a place at the discount store level . Currently , new shoes are being sold at various discount shoe stores like Payless Shoes and Modells around the country . In recent years , Airwalk shoes have started becoming popular again , mainly in the skate shoe department . Airwalk 's rise and fall in popularity is a case study in The Tipping Point : How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference , a best - selling 2002 book by Malcolm Gladwell .
