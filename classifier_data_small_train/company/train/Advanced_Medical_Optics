Advanced Medical Optics , Inc. , ( NYSE : EYE ) ( known as AMO ) is a global medical device leader focused on the discovery and delivery of innovative vision technologies that optimize the quality of life for people of all ages . Products in the ophthalmic surgical line include intraocular lenses , laser vision correction systems , phacoemulsification systems , viscoelastics , microkeratomes and related products used in cataract and refractive surgery . AMO is based in Santa Ana , California , and employs approximately 4,200 worldwide . The company has operations in 24 countries and markets products in approximately 60 countries . AMO was spun off from Allergan in 2002 . AMO volunatrily recalled some of their products in 2006 due to a bacterial contamination in the factory process which would have compromised sterility . Non - sterility of a contact lens solution may have serious health consequences , including eye infection and microbial keratitis . The voluntary and limited recall was caused by an isolated production line problem that affected two of the four production lines in the AMO facility , not because of a formulation issue . This happened in the midst of a recall scare period caused by Bausch & Lomb 's worldwide product recall , after eye care doctors in Singapore traced 90 % of their patients ' eye infections , some to the serious extent of causing blindness , to B&L products . In actual fact , no reports of adverse health effects due to the suspected - affected batch of products were made to AMO . AMO 's immediate voluntary recall was applauded by many as a considerate act towards their product users , because they were seen as being more concerned about the potential effects of the contamination on their users rather than a risk of association with serious eye health problems after the initial recall scares . In some countries , there were initial confusion between B&L 's product dangers and AMO 's voluntary recall .
