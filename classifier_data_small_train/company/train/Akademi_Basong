Akademi Basong , or the Basong Academy , is a non - profit institution established by Basong Malaysia that serves as an advisory forum . The Academy 's main object is to make recommendations of economic policies to the Government ( principally the Prime Minister , Dato ' Seri Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi and the Deputy Prime Minister , Dato ' Sri Mohd . Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak ) of Malaysia . Akademi Basong 's predecessors were the Family Business Research Centre and the Plastics Recycling Research Centre under the Office of the Chief Strategist of Basong Malaysia . In 2003 , those research centres , as well as other research units , were consolidated to form the Academy , and academicians have been elected from outside Basong Malaysia ( even outside Malaysia ) . There have since been academicians from India , Malaysia and New Zealand . The Secretariat to the Academy is therefore established in the Office of the Chief Strategist of Basong Malaysia . The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were formally informed of the establishment of the Academy , and have been advised on various economic and political issues . However , according to its Statutes , the Academy shall not acquire any property or involve in any financial activity . The number of Akademikus , or the Academicians , shall not be more than 26 , and all must be natural persons . There shall be 3 officeholders : the Director ( the chairperson of meetings ) , the Chancellor ( considered the president ) and the Perpetual Secretary ( the chief executive officer ) . They cannot be paid .
