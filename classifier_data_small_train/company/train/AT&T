AT&T Inc. ( NYSE : T ) is the largest provider of both local and long distance telephone services , wireless service under the brand Cingular Wireless , and DSL Internet access in the United States . The current AT&T , which is based in San Antonio , Texas , United States , is the rechristened name of SBC Communications , following the purchase of its former parent company , AT&T Corp . As a part of the merger , SBC shed its name and took on the iconic AT&T moniker and the T stock - trading symbol ( for " telephone " ) . Although the corporation is considered SBC renamed , most of its major subsidiaries were part of AT&T prior to 1984 , including the Bell Operating Companies and the long distance division . However , AT&T lacks the vertical integration it once had , which had been the reason for the anti - trust suits that led to the 1984 breakup and the accusations of monopoly associated with the Bell System divestiture . On January 31 , 2005 , SBC announced that it would purchase AT&T for more than $16 billion . The announcement came almost 8 years after SBC and AT&T called off their first merger talks and nearly a year after initial merger talks between AT&T and BellSouth fell apart . AT&T stockholders , meeting in Denver , approved the merger on June 30 , 2005 . The U.S. Department of Justice cleared the merger on October 27 , 2005 , and the Federal Communications Commission approved it on October 31 , 2005 . The merger was finalized on November 18 2005 . SBC announced that the name of the merged company would be AT&T , Inc. , and it adopted an updated logo . On December 1 , 2005 the combined company began trading under the historic " T " stock ticker symbol on the NYSE . To differentiate from the preceding company , AT&T is formally known as " AT&T Inc. " , while the preceding company was " AT&T Corp. " . On Friday December 29 , 2006 , the FCC approved the acquisition of BellSouth valued at approximately $86 billion ( or 1.325 shares of AT&T for each share of BellSouth at the close of trading December 29 , 2006 ) .
