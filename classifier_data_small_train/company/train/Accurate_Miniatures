Accurate Miniatures is an American manufactuter of scale plastic model kits . It is owned by Collins - Habovick , LLC and is located in Concord , North Carolina , United States . Their products primarily consist plastic model airplane kits from World War II , though they also make model kits of planes and automobiles from other eras . The original Accurate Miniatures was a Charlotte , NC based plastic model company that began business in the mid 1990s . They filed for bankruptcy in June 2001 . Later that year , Accurate Miniatures was purchased from the original owners by Hobby Investors LLC , now called Collins - Habovick , LLC . The transfer included the sale of the company name , logo , inventory , and intellectual property . Paul Bedford , former general manager of the original Accurate Miniatures claims the deal was part cash and part debt assumption . In July 2001 , Accurate Miniatures , in an attempt to get out of debt , prepared to sell as much as 70 % of their tooling ( model molds ) to the Bologna , Italy based Italeri . Some of the molds included molds for the Avenger , Dauntless , Grumman F3F , Mustang , Stormovik , and Yak kits . However , the sell to Hobby Investors LLC nullified this deal . Today , Accurate Miniatures is an apparently successful company that is praised by model builders for their high - quality kits and attention to detail .
