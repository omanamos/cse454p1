The County Ground is a football stadium located near the town centre of Swindon , England . It is home to Swindon Town Football Club and has been for over a century . The current capacity is 15,728 , all - seated . A record attendance of 32,000 was set on 15 January , 1972 , against Arsenal in the 3rd round of the FA Cup . To the north of the football stadium is Swindon Cricket Club . Their pitch is also named The County Ground . Swindon Town have been playing at the County Ground since 1896 . They played their games on the site of the adjacent cricket pitch also called the County Ground from 1893 until the ground opened . Thomas Arkell of Arkell 's Brewery donated Â£300 to finance the construction of a stand on what was then known as the ' Wiltshire County Ground ' , this investment was enough to begin development of a purpose built football ground . The addition of floodlights in 1951 gave Swindon the honour of being the first League club to do so , beating Arsenal by just a couple of weeks . Additions included the building of the " new " all - seater Arkell 's ( or North ) stand in 1971 ( on the site of the original ) and following the Hillsborough disaster ; the County Ground was converted to an all - seater stadium beginning with the addition of extra seating in front of the North Stand and the building of a sponsored stand ( originally the Intel Stand , now the Nationwide Stand ) in the early 90s . The Nationwide Stand replaced the Shrivenham Road enclosure , a two - tiered terrace . During the stand 's history , a fire broke out on the top tier making the upper area unsafe . During it 's later years of use , the upper tier was used by Television Cameras and Crowd monitoring only . The County Ground is also the only football stadium in the world with the most prestigious name in watch making acting as its timekeeper - Rolex , who 's famous logo adorns the clock on the Stratton Bank stand . The ground itself is on land owned by Swindon Borough Council to whom the club pay rent . Swindon have in the past considered a move to a club owned stadium to generate more revenue , but have not had the financial backing to do so . In 2006 a redevelopment campaign for the County Ground began , with the club and TrustSTFC ( the supporters ' trust ) raising a petition to ' Save Our Home ' urging the Borough Council to " facilitate the redevelopment of the stadium and do everything they can to keep the club within the Borough " including the proposed upgrading of the adjacent Cricket Club to County standard and Athletic Club to Olympic standard . Located on the north side of pitch . The majority of this stand was constructed in 1971 , with extra seating being added near the pitch - side in the late 80s / Early 90s . At either end of the stand are large windshields , and there are two roof - supporting beams within the stand . It contains an executive seating area , VIP lounge , the players ' dressing rooms and a tunnel out onto the pitch .
