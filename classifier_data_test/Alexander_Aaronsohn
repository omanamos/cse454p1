Alexander Aaronsohn ( 1888â€“1948 ) was an author and activist who wrote about the plight of people living in Palestine ( now Israel ) in his book , With the Turks in Palestine . Aaronsohn was part of the influential Aaronsohn family who were major figures in the Zionist movement ; his brother was Aaron Aaronsohn . Aaronsohn 's parents emigrated from Romania to Palestine with other Jewish families and founded the community of Zikhron Ya'aqov in the fertile region south of Mount Carmel . Aaronsohn was born in this small village and grew up amongst a blooming agricultural community . In 1910 Aaronsohn left for America on the advice of his brother who headed the Jewish Experiment Station at Athlit . He received his naturalization papers a few days after arrival and obtained work with the Department of Agriculture . Aaronsohn returned to Palestine in July 1913 intending to make Zionist propaganda to spread to the United States . Two months after his return Aaronsohn learned of an attack on a well - respected Jewish doctor by four Arabs and the rape of a young sixteen - year old Jewish girl . This event shocked Aaronsohn and he vowed to form a strong society that would protect the life and honor of villagers . Despite Aaronsohn 's ties to the United States , he was pushed into serving in the Turkish Army with the start of the first World War as the Ottoman Empire controlled Palestine . Aaronsohn and twenty of his acquaintances began this passage by presenting themselves at the recruiting station in Acco . They were then marched off to Han and made to wait with hundreds of impoverished Arabs . Aaronsohn was subsequently ordered to travel to Saffed , where his garrison was located . Aaronsohn and his troupe 's four day march to Saffed was an arduous journey in the heat of the September sun . They were required to obtain their own food and the poor Arabs caused conflict by stealing from villages that they passed by . On arrival in Saffed they were informed that a dirty deserted mosque would serve as their barracks . Project Gutenberg ( 2007 ) .
