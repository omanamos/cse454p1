AT&T Park ( formerly known as SBC Park and Pacific Bell Park ) is an open - air baseball stadium , home to the San Francisco Giants of the National League . The park also hosts the Emerald Bowl , a College football bowl game , every year . The park is located at 24 Willie Mays Plaza , at the corner of 3rd Street and King Street in the South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco , California . The stadium was officially renamed AT&T Park on March 1 , 2006 , just two years after it adopted the SBC Park name . SBC Communications , the flagship sponsor of the park , rebranded itself as AT&T Inc. when it merged with AT&T Corp. in late 2005 . This marks the second renaming for the park since its opening in 2000 . Groundbreaking on the ballpark began on December 11 , 1997 in the industrial waterfront area of San Francisco known as China Basin and South Beach . The stadium cost $319 million to build and supplanted the Giants ' former home , Candlestick Park , a multi - use stadium in southern San Francisco . A team of engineers from UC Davis was consulted in the design process of the park resulting in wind levels that are approximately half those at Candlestick . Fans had shivered through 40 seasons at " The Stick , " and looked forward to warmer temperatures at the new ballpark . However , cold summer fog and winter jackets in July are still not unusual at Giants games at AT&T Park , as the stadium like its predecessor is built right on San Francisco Bay . The temperatures though are much warmer and improved . When it opened on March 31 , 2000 , the ballpark was the first Major League Baseball stadium built in the U.S. without public funds since the completion of Dodger Stadium in 1962 , though the Giants did receive a $10 million tax abatement from the city and $80 million for upgrades to the local infrastructure ( including a connection to the Muni Metro ) . The Giants have a 66 - year lease on the 12.5 - acre ballpark site , paying $1.2 million in rent annually to the San Francisco Port Commission . The park opened with a seating capacity of 40,800 , but this has increased over time as seats have been added . The opening series took place between April 11 , 2000 and April 13 , 2000 against the Los Angeles Dodgers , where the Giants were swept in 3 games . In the first game of that series , the Giants suffered a 6 - 5 loss to the Dodgers , highlighted by a three home run day by Kevin Elster . In just its first few years of existence , the ballpark has seen its share of historic events primarily due to veteran Giants outfielder Barry Bonds . On April 17 , 2001 , Bonds hit his 500th career home run at then Pacific Bell Park . Later that year , he set the single season home run record when he hit home runs number 71 , 72 , and 73 over the weekend of October 5th to close the season . On August 9 , 2002 , Bonds hit his 600th career home run at the park . On April 12 , 2004 , Bonds hit career home run 660 at SBC Park to tie Willie Mays for third on the all - time list and on the next night ,
