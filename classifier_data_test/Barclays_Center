The Barclays Center is a proposed sports arena to be built partly on a platform over the Metropolitan Transportation Authority - owned Atlantic Yards at Atlantic Avenue in the New York City borough of Brooklyn . It is part of a proposed $3.5 billion sports arena , business and residential complex . The site is intended to serve as a new home for the New Jersey Nets , currently based at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford , New Jersey . The MTA site is 8.3 acres ( 34,000 m² ) ; the Atlantic Yards project site would be 22 acres ( 89,000 m² ) . The arena , along with the rest of the complex , is a project of Brooklyn developer Bruce Ratner , who acquired the Nets in 2004 , with the purpose of moving them from New Jersey to this site near the Atlantic Avenue - Pacific Street New York City Subway station and the Long Island Rail Road terminus in Brooklyn , one of the most transit - accessible locations in the city . The move would mark the return of major league sports to Brooklyn , which has been absent since the departure of the Dodgers to Los Angeles in 1957 ( their proposal for a new stadium at the Atlantic Yards to replace the unprofitable Ebbets Field had been turned down by the city in the past ) . Ratner 's group hopes to have the arena open for the 2009 - 10 season . Designed by architect Frank Gehry , the arena would host the Nets , along with concerts , conventions and other sporting events , competing with Madison Square Garden and the Prudential Center , which is currently under construction , among other facilities . The arena 's roof would feature a park open only to residents of the Atlantic Yards complex , ringed by an open - air running track that doubles as a skating rink in winter with panoramic vistas facing Manhattan year - round . It has been reported that London - based Barclays Bank has agreed to pay the team $400 million over the next 20 years for the naming rights of their future Brooklyn home . On January 18 , 2007 it was announced that the arena would be called Barclays Center , becoming the second major league sports venue to be called a center in the NYC metro area . Recently , the future home to the New Jersey Devils hockey team in Newark , New Jersey was named the Prudential Center . Along with most stadium and arena proposals that utilize public money and / or property , the Atlantic Yards project is not without controversy . The development of the project , which is endorsed by the MTA and mayor Michael Bloomberg , has been strongly supported by Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz and is popular among some Brooklynites . But , it has also been opposed by a number of community groups in the area , and New York City Council member Letitia James , who points to the mixed successes of Ratner 's previous projects , increased traffic congestion , and what she and her constituents see as the unfair exercise of eminent domain to remove residents for a commercial interest . Advocates of the project have claimed that the area is blighted in defense of using eminent domain , yet the area is in one of the hottest real estate markets in the United States . Roger Green , an early supporter of the project , stated unequivocally that
