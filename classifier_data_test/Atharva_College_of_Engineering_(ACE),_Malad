Atharva College of Engineering was initially founded in year 1999 at Borivali ( W ) , Mumbai. . It was located in a temporary building adjacent to MK college and in the premises of a junior school in Borivli . Later on , it moved onto its own campus in Charkop , Malad ( W ) in the year 2001 . As of now ( year 2007 ) the college has three streams of engineering taught here - Electronics and Telecommunication , Computers and Information technology . The prescribed strength of each class is 90 although it is normally exceeded by 10 - 15 students . The building infrastructure especially the reception area and the office is very aesthetically pleasing . The canteen , too , was beautiful until they halved it in size to make room for another classroom . Now it is just plain overcrowded . The college canteen once had Landmark Hotel ( from Link Road , Evershine Nagar ) catering for them , but now the current caterers serve poor quality & quantity food at reduced rates . The dishes are usually a health hazard in themselves . The Engineering building also houses the management section which is on the 4th floor . The adjacent building houses the catering section and also a canteen that is manned by some of the catering staff . Attendance , has now become a stricter policy for a college that was once accused of being too lax . There is also a swimming pool on the campus which is solely for use of the Club members . Students are n't allowed as of now to make use of the facilities . University rules require Head of Departments to at least hold a Master 's degree - a rule not followed . Did not have a Principal appointed for quite a while . Training and Placement office historically has been non - functional for the most part . Shri Sunil Rane is the Secretary of Atharva Educational Trust . Currently , the once dubious college has acquired a reputation and good standing . However , the state of equipment in its labs ( as with any other college ) do leave a fair amount to be desired.Prof . Varsha Bhosale is now the new Vice - Principal of the college . 1st College in Mumbai University which is having Internet connection of 8 hrs 2.5 Mbit / s 1:1 Raw bandwidth which is also available in other engineering colleges .
