Alexandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn ( Russian : Алекса́ндр Иса́евич Солжени́цын , IPA : ; born December 11 , 1918 ) is a Russian novelist , dramatist and historian . Through his writings , he made the world aware of the Gulag , the Soviet labor camp system , and , for these efforts , Solzhenitsyn was both awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970 and exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974 . He returned to Russia in 1994 . In 1994 , he was elected as a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in the Department of Language and Literature . Alexandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk , Russia , the son of a young widowed mother , Taisia Solzhenitsyna ( née Scherbak ) , whose father had risen , it seems , from humble beginnings , much of a self - made man , and acquired a large estate in the Kuban region by the northern foothills of the Caucasus . During World War I , the daughter had gone to study in Moscow , where she met Isaaky Solzhenitsyn , a young army officer , also from the Caucasus region ( the family background of his parents is vividly brought alive in the opening chapters of August 1914 , and later on in the Red Wheel novel cycle ) . In 1918 , his young wife became pregnant , but soon after this was confirmed , Isaaky was killed in a hunting accident . Alexandr was raised by his mother and aunt in lowly circumstances ; his earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War and the family property was , of course , turned into a kolkhoz by 1930 .

His mother encouraged his literary and scientific leanings ; she died shortly before 1940 . Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov State University , while at the same time taking correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy , Literature , and History ( at this time heavily ideological in scope ; as he himself makes clear , he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union before he had spent some time in the camps ) . During World War II , he served as the commander of an artillery position finding company in the Red Army , was involved in major action at the front , and was twice decorated . In February 1945 , while serving in East Prussia he was arrested for criticising Joseph Stalin in private correspondence with a friend and sentenced to an eight - year term in a labour camp , to be followed by permanent internal exile . The first part of Solzhenitsyn 's sentence was served in several different work camps ; the " middle phase " , as he later referred to it , was spent in a sharashka , special scientific research facilities run by Ministry of State Security : these formed the experiences distilled in The First Circle , published in the West in 1968 . In 1950 , he was sent to a " Special Camp " for political prisoners . During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan , he worked as a miner , bricklayer , and foundryman . His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . While there he had
