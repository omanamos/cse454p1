Charlotte Perkins Gilman ( July 3 1860 – August 17 1935 ) was a prominent American non - fiction writer , short story writer , novelist , commercial artist , lecturer , and social reformer . She is mainly known today for her short story " The Yellow Wallpaper , " based on her own bout with mental illness and misguided medical treatment . Gilman was born Charlotte Anna Perkins in Hartford , Connecticut , the daughter of Mary Perkins ( formerly Mary Fitch Westcott ) and Frederick Beecher Perkins , a well - known librarian and magazine editor , and niece of Harriet Beecher Stowe , author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin . She had a brother Thomas Aide , who was fourteen months older than she . Her father was rarely home , leaving his wife and daughter with his progressive aunts Harriet Beecher Stowe , Catharine Beecher , advocate of domestic feminism , and Isabella Beecher Hooker , suffragist and supporter of women’s right to vote.Gilman reported that her mother only showed affection when she thought her two children were asleep . Gilman also had 2 siblings that died as infants . Afterwards her mother was told she would never have another child , and the father left them . Possibly he left her because he was afraid he would kill his wife if she got pregnant again . Afterwards , the three lived on the brink of poverty , moving from relative to relative . After two years at the Rhode Island School of Design , Gilman supported herself as a greeting - card artist . She married Charles Walter Stetson , a fellow artist , in 1884 , and her only child , Katharine Beecher Stetson , was born the following year , 1885 . During this time—and throughout her life—she suffered from depression , which influenced her writing . She separated from her husband in 1888 ( divorcing him six years later ) , and moved with her daughter to California , where she was active in organizing for social reform movements ; she lectured across the country and in the United Kingdom . Her daughter subsequently went to live with her ex - husband and his second wife , Grace Ellery Channing , who was also Gilman’s best friend since childhood . Gilman was genuinely happy for the couple , despite the circumstances , and said that Channing probably made a better mother then she could have in many ways . For a time she lived in a so - called Boston marriage with Adeline Knapp , a San Francisco newspaper reporter who shared her interests in social reform and the Nationalist Club , based on Edward Bellamy 's socialist utopian vision . Her second marriage was to her first cousin , New York lawyer George Houghton Gilman and lasted from 1900 to his death in 1934 . In her letters to him , she worried that her correspondence with Knapp would be published and cause a scandal . In 1922 Gilman moved from New York to Norwich , Connecticut , where she wrote His Religion and Hers . Following the death of her husband in 1934 she moved back to Pasadena in order to be closer to her daughter . Soon thereafter she was diagnosed with breast cancer , which was considered inoperable . Gilman’s mother had also died of cancer , and after watching her suffer , she said that if she had ever got cancer she would kill herself rather than suffer . She committed suicide on August 17 1935 by
