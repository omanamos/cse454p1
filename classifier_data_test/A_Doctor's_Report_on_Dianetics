A Doctor 's Report on Dianetics : Theory and Therapy is a non - fiction book analyzing Dianetics . The book was authored by Joseph Augustus Winter , M.D. , with an introduction by Frederick Perls , M.D. , Ph.D . The book was first published in hardcover by Julian Messner , in 1951 , and published again in 1987 , by Crown Publishing Group . The work was the first book published that was critical of L. Ron Hubbard . Dr. Winter had previously served on the Board of Directors of L. Ron Hubbard 's Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation , but resigned in October 1950 over differences on how to employ the Dianetics techniques . Dr. Winter was also Medical Director of the Foundation . He also wrote the introduction to Hubbard 's Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Prior to his falling out with Hubbard , Dr. Winter stated that he had used Dianetics to cure his six - year - old son of fears of ghosts and the dark . A Doctor 's Report on Dianetics : Theory and Therapy gives credit to the concepts of Dianetics which the author adheres to , and also cites the particular issues that Dr. Winter disagrees with . Dr. Winter agreed with L. Ron Hubbard 's concept of the engram , writing that engrams can be formed in the prenatal stage , but he disagreed with Hubbard 's concept of the " sperm dream " , asserting that this was something purely imagined by the patient . This concept was later analyzed in Culture and Experience . Dr. Winter also objected to patients recalling deaths from previous reincarnations , Hubbard 's authoritarian attitude and disregard for usage of the scientific method , and Hubbard 's view that anyone could become an auditor . According to Winter , repeated attempts to try to convince Hubbard to utlize a minimum standard upon which to test student applicants was not successful . Dr. Winter wrote that Hubbard 's techniques did not always cure , but sometimes harmed the patient , and that he had yet to observe a single " Clear " . Though Hubbard claimed that a Clear had been obtained after twenty - four hours of therapy , Dr. Winter never observed an individual reach the state of Clear or display any of the unique abilities attributed to a Clear by Hubbard during his time practicing Dianetics . Dr. Winter also believed that some people became psychotic due to their involvement with Dianetics , and he included a case study in the book . Dr. Winter also took time in his book to rebuke Hubbard 's " Guk " program , which was a combination of vitamins and glutamic acid that was meant to make dianetics subjects " run better " . The work was called an important new book on psychotherapy , in Pastoral Psychology . Gardner analyzes the book extensively in Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science . Gardner wrote that the " most revealing " material in A Doctor 's Report on Dianetics , were the records of the author 's own auditing sessions . Aleksandrovich wrote in The Ways and Power of Love that though Dr. Winter wrote an enthusiastic " Introduction " to Hubbard 's Dianetics , his own book exposed some of Hubbard 's more " charlatanish " claims . The book was also reviewed in The American Journal of Psychology and The American Journal of Psychiatry . In a review of the book in Psychosomatic Medicine , Egloff wrote
