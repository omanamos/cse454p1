The American University of Armenia ( AUA ) is a private , nonsectarian , independent university founded in 1991 in Yerevan , Armenia . Its creation inspired in the aftermath of the 1988 Leninakan Earthquake , the university is the first Armenian institution modeled on Western - style higher education , committed to teaching , research , and service . As of 2006 , it serves only graduate students . The university currently offers instruction leading to a master 's degree in the following eight fields of study : business administration , industrial engineering and systems management , computer and information science , political science , public health , law , comparative legal studies , and teaching English as a foreign language . By offering these programs in English , AUA strives to become accessible to qualified individuals from other countries in the region . Qualified students may complete an interdisciplinary Certificate in Environmental Conservation and Research . In preparation for the academic program , AUA offers its students instruction in the English language and in computer applications . Following the Leninakan Earthquake , a number of earthquake engineers from the West went to Armenia . In 1989 , Yuri Sarkissian , then rector of the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute , suggested to Armen Der Kiureghian , Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of California , Berkeley , that an Armenian technical university based on the Western model ought to be established to foster educational progress in Armenia . The proposition was narrowed to the express goal of creating a graduate university on the American model . Der Kiureghian and another earthquake engineer , Mihran Agbabian , Professor Emeritus at the University of Southern California , set out to realize the goal . A number of American and Armenian academics supported the concept of the university . Der Kiureghian and Agbabian , along with the late Stepan Karamardian , formerly Dean of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management at the University of California , Riverside , presented their proposal for the university to the Armenian government . Two institutions were noteworthy in realizing the establishment of AUA : the Armenian General Benevolent Union ( AGBU ) and the University of California ( UC ) . In addition , the Armenian government—in particular the Ministry of Higher Education and Sciences ( now the Ministry of Education and Science ) —offered financial and logistical support for the university from the start in the face of the turbulent political and economic circumstances in Armenia from the period of 1989–1991 . The AGBU underwrote a significant portion of the operational funding required to establish AUA . When the UC was asked for its assistance in founding the university , David P. Gardner , then president of the University of California , appointed a task force led by then Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs William R. Frazer to evaluate the possibility of an affiliation between the AUA and the UC . After the task force 's visit to Armenia in July 1990 , the Regents of the University of California voted unanimously in favor of an affiliation with the university . Through this affiliation , the UC provides technical support and experience for the growth of AUA and collaborates with the AUA in preparing a cadre of faculty for the university . When on September 21 , 1991 Armenia declared its independence , AUA began instruction with 101 students . On October 6 , 2005 , it was announced that Vartkes and Hasmig Barsam were donating the Hye Business Suites Hotel (
