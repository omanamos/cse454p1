The College 's stated mission is " to prepare graduates who think critically , serve generously , lead purposefully and live responsibly as stewards of the world they bequeath to future generations. " . Alma College was one of 81 schools in the United States selected in 2005 as a " College with a Conscience : 81 Great Schools with Outstanding Community Involvement " by The Princeton Review and Campus Compact . The College was founded by Michigan Presbyterians in 1886 , and received funding from lumber magnate Ammi Wright , for whom Wright Hall on campus and Wright Avenue in the city of Alma are named . At one point the mascot was the Fighting Presbyterians , but according to most sources , it just was n't very intimidating . While still maintaining a close relationship with the Presbyterian Church , Alma College offers an environment that welcomes students of all religious backgrounds . In January 1997 , then - president of Alma College , Alan Stone , asked 480 colleges to boycott the U.S. News and World Report Rankings due to the peer assessment survey which counts for 25 % of a college 's ranking . According to the Chronicle of Higher Education , in 1996 , Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings . The result of the survey indicated that " 84 per cent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar with some of the institutions they had been asked to rank . Almost 44 per cent indicated that they ' tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.

" , After a June 2007 meeting of the Annapolis Group , Alma college joined others who would be boycotting the rankings . President Dr. Saundra Tracy said she agreed with a majority of her peers at a meeting this week to stop participating in the personality assessment portion of the annual college rankings published by U.S. News and World Report . A consensus was taken at the end of an annual meeting of the Annapolis Group , an association of liberal arts colleges . Tracy supported the action and criticized the magazineâ€˜s unscientific process to rate the popularity and reputation of a school based on what presidents , provosts and admission deans say in a survey . Alma utilizes a 4 - 4 - 1 academic calendar with 14 - week terms in the fall and winter and a four - week term in May . Incoming freshmen and transfer students arrive a week earlier than returning students in late August for " Preterm , " which comprises activities designed to introduce new Scots to campus life and a one - credit class that acclimates new students to academic life .
