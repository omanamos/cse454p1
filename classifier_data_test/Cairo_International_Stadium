Cairo International Stadium ( Arabic : ستاد القاهرة الدولي ) or " Stad El - Qahira El - Dawly " , is an Olympic - standard , multi - use stadium with an all - seated capacity of 74,100 . It is the Middle East and Africa 's largest and foremost Olympic - standard facility befitting the role of Cairo , Egypt as the center of events in the region . Located in Nasr City ; a suburb north east of Cairo , it was completed in 1960 , and was inaugurated by the late President Nasser on the 23rd of July national day celebrations that year . In 2005 in preparation for the 2006 African Cup of Nations it underwent a major renovation , and was brought up to 21st century world standard along with all its multi - game Olympic facilities . The Stadium is located about 10 km east of Cairo International Airport and about 30 km ( 30 min ) from downtown Cairo . Cairo Stadium is known for its tremendous atmosphere and its very large capacity . This was never more evident than during the 2006 African cup of Nations , which were held in Egypt . When Egypt had their matches in Cairo Stadium , the stadium seemed to nearly erupt . Before seats were added to all sections in 2005 , the stadium was notorious for holding more people than it was intended to . It is rumored to have hosted over 120 thousand fans for a match between zamalek football club and al - ahly football club . Without seats , fans were able to squeeze together and sit in aisles . Cairo Stadium is a strong symbol of Egyptian football . Nearly all of the most important Egyptian matches are held there . It carries an extremely rich history which includes many timeless soccer moments that ranges from Hossam Hassan 's famous header to secure Egypt 's attendance in Italia 90 World Cup , numerous Africa Cup of Nations tournaments which included the latest 2006 trophy , and the famous derby matches between Ahly and Zamalek . However , the stadium is to be out - classed and out - dated with the imminent opening of the new Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria , which will house an official count of 80,000 spectators making it larger than Cairo International Stadium and more modern , thus the largest in Egypt and one of the biggest grounds in Africa and the Middle East in term of capacity .
