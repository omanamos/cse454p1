Template : ScientologySeriesA Piece of Blue Sky : Scientology , Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed is a book written in 1990 by Jon Atack , investigating L. Ron Hubbard and his enterprises such as Dianetics and the Church of Scientology . A Piece of Blue Sky has been cited as a principal source of reference in academic papers by professor of sociology and history of religion Stephen Kent , Ph.D. and by professor of neuropsychiatry Louis Jolyon West , M.D. . The book is available in its entirety on the internet here . Before the book had even been released , Scientology attorneys sought to have a stop put to it in court . Their efforts were unsuccessful . In 1995 , a British court found Atack guilty of libel against Margaret Hodkin , the headmistress of Scientology 's Greenfields School in the U.K. and issued an injunction against Atack forbidding him from publishing the offending paragraph on page 336 of the book . The paragraph , however , is available to be read in full on the court injunction itself . Amazon.com was the subject of controversy when it removed the book from its listings , then reversed itself and included it after public outcry . It was 1950 , in the early , heady days of Dianetics , soon after L. Ron Hubbard opened the doors of his first organization to the clamoring crowd . Up until then , Hubbard was known only to readers of pulp fiction , but now he had an instant best - seller with a book that promised to solve every problem of the human mind , and the cash was pouring in . Hubbard found it easy to create schemes to part his new following from their money . One of the first tasks was to arrange " grades " of membership , offering supposedly greater rewards , at increasingly higher prices . Over thirty years later , an associate wryly remembered Hubbard turning to him and confiding , no doubt with a smile , " Let 's sell these people a piece of blue sky. " .
