The Dunkin ' Donuts Center is an indoor arena located in Providence , Rhode Island , USA . Built in 1972 , the arena was built as a place for the emerging Providence College men 's basketball program and the high demand for tickets to their games in Alumni Hall , as well as for the then - Providence Reds , who played in the nearly fifty - year old Rhode Island Auditorium . The arena was known as the Providence Civic Center until a naming rights deal was reached with Dunkin ' Donuts in June 2001 . Current tenants include the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League and the Providence College Friars men 's basketball team . It has been the site of many collegiate tournaments , including the inaugural 1980 Big East Conference men 's basketball tournament ; several ECAC basketball tournaments ; NCAA basketball tournament first - and second - round games in 1976 , 1979 , 1980 , 1981 , 1989 , and 1996 ; the 1978 and 1985 basketball regionals ; the inaugural 1985 Hockey East Tournament ( won by the home team ) ; and the 1995 and 2000 NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championships . The University of Rhode Island has also played home basketball games at Dunkin ' Donuts Center , although this practice has stopped with the opening of the Ryan Center in 2002 . On rare occasions , the PC women 's basketball team has played " home " games in the arena , most notably for games against URI or UConn , where demand for tickets would be enough to warrant an arena larger than the 2,620 - seat Alumni Hall . The New England Steamrollers of the Arena Football League called the arena home in 1988 . The Providence Reds hockey team played there for five years starting in 1972 . The venue has long been a regular stop on WWE tours . It was the site of WWF King of the Ring tournaments five times and hosted the 1994 Royal Rumble . In 1999 the Dunkin ' Donuts Center was home to the WWE Backlash Pay - Per - View event . In 2005 this venue hosted WWE Armageddon on December 18 , 2005 presented by SmackDown ! and Xbox 360 . A number of other professional sporting events ( such as the Harlem Globetrotters ) , as well as rock , pop , and opera concerts have occurred there as well . In December of 2005 , the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the building from the City of Providence for $28.5 million . A major reconstruction ( which will include an expansion of the arena seating capacity ) is underway . The Authority will spend $62 million on the renovation of the " Dunk " to transform the facility into a state - of - the - art arena . Two major elements of the construction include an expanded lobby and an enclosed pedestrian bridge between the Convention Center and the Dunkin’ Donuts Center .
