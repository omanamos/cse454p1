The Arke Stadion is the official stadium of football club FC Twente . It is located in Enschede , Netherlands , at the Business & Science Park , near the University of Twente . It has a spectator capacity of 13,250 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences for the tribunes . The Arke Stadion replaces the old Diekman Stadion as FC Twente 's home ground on 22 March 1998 . Plans have been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion , however , with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough , the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the Twente fans . The Diekman ground had also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of the FIFA regulations which imposes a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post . The cost of the construction was estimated to be around 33 million guilders and took fourteen months to complete , with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997 . Due to the tight budget available , the layout of the stadium was constructed in such that future expansions may be made possible without the necessity to tear down entire tribunes . The first match played at the stadium was a historic 3 - 0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match . On October the first 2006 , the stadium got updated with two big flatscreen video - walls . In 2006 plans have been unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,244 seats .
