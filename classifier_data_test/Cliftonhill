Cliftonhill opened on December 24 , 1919 . The Main Stand sits high on a rise above Main Street and was built following Albion Roversâ€™ only Scottish Cup Final appearance in season 1919 - 20 . A roof extension over the paddock ( a standing area in front of the stand ) was added in 1994 . The Main Stand and paddock are the only parts of the stadium normally used nowadays and the current capacity is listed as 1,238 . In its heyday , Cliftonhill housed many thousand more people and its record attendance was set on February 8 , 1936 when 27,381 watched the visit of Rangers . Floodlighting was installed at the ground in October 1968 and since then , Cliftonhill has at various times staged speedway , greyhound racing and stock car racing as well as football . During the 1990s it looked likely that Albion Rovers would leave Cliftonhill to share a stadium with local rivals Airdrieonians . However opposition from Rovers fans , the local population and others , saw that move fall through and the club are currently working on plans to redevelop the stadium . Trivia : in 2006 the front entrance to Cliftonhill featured in a UK television advert for Flash . Address : Cliftonhill Stadium , Main Street , Coatbridge , ML5 3RB . Club Shop : Open one hour prior to kick - off at first team home matches .
