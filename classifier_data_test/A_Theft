A Theft is a 1989 novel by the American author Saul Bellow . Bellow originally wanted to publish the book as a story or serial in a magazine such as the New Yorker , but his agent had trouble selling it to any magazine . Bellow , instead , chose to publish it as a book , and it was his first book to be published in paperback form , which was something highly unusual for a book written by an erudite and respected author . Bellow himself said on the television show Good Morning America that the book had the quality of a hardcover book , but lacked the requisite number of pages and , hence , was published as a trade paperback . Clara Velde is a successful fashion writer in New York City and the star of the story . The book 's title refers to the disappearance of Clara 's prized emerald ring . Clara associates the ring with her love for the Washington , D.C. politico Ithiel and with her own professional and personal power . The ring 's apparent theft leads Clara into a series of psychological crises and forces her to confront a long - buried complex of interpersonal issues .
