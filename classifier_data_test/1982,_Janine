1982 , Janine is a novel by the Scottish author Alasdair Gray . His second , it was published in 1984 . Its use of pornography as a narrative device attracted much criticism , although others , including Gray himself , consider it his best work . The novel is narrated by Jock McLeish , a supervisor of the installation of alarm systems . Divorced , alcoholic and approaching fifty , his problems coalesce in a long night of the soul in a hotel room in Greenock . McLeish attempts to spend the night assembling an intricate pornographic fantasy . His cast of characters includes : Janine , based on a childhood memory of Jane Russell in The Outlaw ; Superb ( short for Superbitch ) ; and Big Momma , an obese lesbian . All of these are submitted to sadomasochistic practices , parts of which are described at some length . However , McLeish constantly returns to reminiscences of his previous life and lovers . These prompt his attempted suicide . Chapter 11 of the novel is a typographical explosion , with the text splitting into several parallel voices on each page ( including that of God ) . The crisis concludes with McLeish vomiting up the pills which he had hoped would kill him , and facing the truth of his actions as morning dawns . On the dust jacket of the hardback edition , Gray wrote that " Every stylistic excess and moral defect which critics conspired to ignore in the author 's first books . . . is to be found here in concentrated form. " . The paperback edition of the novel concludes with an appendix of criticism of the work , both for and against . Critics praising the work included Jonathan Baumbach in the New York Times ( " 1982 Janine has a verbal energy , an intensity of vision " ) and William Boyd in the Times Literary Supplement ( " His style is limpid and classically elegant " ) . The Boyd quotation is juxtaposed with one from Paul Ableman in The Literary Review criticising the " irritating mannerisms " . Peter Levi on the BBC called the book " Radioactive hogwash " , while Joe Ambrose of The Irish Sunday Tribune called the author " a vainglorious lout " and " a profoundly reactionary penman " . In an introduction to the 2003 Canongate Classic edition , Will Self argues that the controversial pornographic fantasies illustrate McLeish 's repression of his past real love affairs , reflect his reactionary political stance , and show the effects of his childhood experiences . McLeish 's linking of sex with the idea of " homecoming " originates in his difficult relationship with his mother . Self also notes the significance of the title , 1982 being " a point at which Scotland could be said to have reached just one of its many nadirs " . This lowpoint included the destruction of the coal industry which had employed McLeish 's father , under a Conservative government of which McLeish is a supporter . Canongate Classics ( 2003 ) .
