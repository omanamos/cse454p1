Bernard Cornwell OBE ( born February 23 , 1944 ) is a prolific and popular English historical novelist . Bernard Cornwell was adopted by a family by the name of Wiggins . After he left them he changed his name to his mother 's maiden name , Cornwell . Cornwell was born in London in 1944 . His father was a Canadian airman . His mother was English , a member of the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force . He was adopted and brought up in Essex by the Wiggins family , who were members of the Peculiar People , a strict Protestant sect who banned frivolity of all kinds and even medicine . Cornwell was sent away to Monkton Combe School , attended the University of London , and after graduating , worked for BBC Television as a director . He married an American , Judy , in 1980 and relocated to the USA . Unable to get a Green Card , he started writing novels , as this did not require a work permit . In June 2006 , Cornwell was awarded an OBE ( Officer , Order of the British Empire ) in the Queen 's 80th Birthday Honours List . Cornwell 's best known books feature the adventures of Richard Sharpe , an English soldier , and are set in the Napoleonic era . After writing 12 books detailing adventures set around various European campaigns over the course of 12 years , further stories covered Sharpe 's earlier years as a young soldier in India . Most of the Napoleonic era books were filmed for a television series starring Sean Bean as Sharpe . Cornwell reportedly was unimpressed by Bean 's casting , but was won over by his performances to the point of dedicating a subsequent Sharpe novel to him . Further books written subsequently have been slotted into different parts of Sharpe 's timeframe . Some Sharpe books have been adapted to become TV movies , but the adaptations are often only loosely based on the book they are named for . This tetralogy is set during the American Civil War . The title character , Nathaniel Starbuck , is a Northerner who has decided to fight for the South . He eventually becomes the commander of a Southern regiment , the Faulconer Legion . This trilogy deals with Arthurian Britain . Like other " historical " takes on the Arthurian legends , the series postulates that Post - Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons , being threatened by invasion from the Anglo - Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West . At the same time , they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms and friction between the old Druidic religion and newly arrived Christianity . This trilogy deals with a mid - 14th century search for the Holy Grail , around the time of the Hundred Years ' War . Cornwell was planning at one point writing more books about the main character Thomas of Hookton and said that shortly after finishing Heretic he " have started another Thomas of Hookton book , then stopped it - mainly because I felt that his story ended in Heretic and I was just trying to get too much for him . Which does n't mean I wo n't pick the idea up again sometime in the future. " . Cornwell 's latest series – The Saxon Stories – is set in 9th century England and focuses on the Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Wessex
