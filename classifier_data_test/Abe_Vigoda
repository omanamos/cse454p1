Abe Vigoda ( born Abraham Charles Vigodah on February 24 , 1921 ) is an American movie and television actor . Vigoda was born in New York City to Lena and Samuel Vigodah , Jewish immigrants from Russia . Vigoda gained fame through his supporting character roles , notably as mobster Sal Tessio in the 1972 movie The Godfather . He later played Detective Sgt . Fish on the television series Barney Miller and its spinoff Fish . Before Barney Miller , he made a few appearances on the ABC - TV soap Dark Shadows . He has appeared on Broadway in Marat / Sade ( 1967 ) , The Man in the Glass Booth ( 1968 ) , Inquest ( 1970 ) , Tough to Get Help ( 1972 ) , and Arsenic and Old Lace ( 1987 ) . He has been mentioned in popular works by artists such as the Beastie Boys and Liz Phair . He makes regular appearances as himself ( usually in skits relating to his age ) on the television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien . In 1982 , Vigoda enjoyed a little extra publicity when People magazine erroneously declared him dead . Vigoda took the error with good humor , posing for a photograph showing him sitting up in a coffin , holding the magazine in question . This rumor was nearly started again in 1987 when a reporter for Secaucus , New Jersey television station WWOR , Channel 9 erroneously referred to him as " the late Abe Vigoda. " . She corrected herself on the air the next day . His erroneous death has remained a running joke for Vigoda . For example , a " Late Night with David Letterman " skit showed Letterman trying to summon the ghost of Vigoda . Abe then walked in and declared , " I'm not dead , you idiot ! " . Also , a November 2006 Conan O'Brien sketch showed an audience member summoning the dead . The " deceased person " turned out to be Vigoda . In 1999 Vigoda experienced a potentially life - threatening situation . While he was a passenger aboard American Airlines Flight 180 from San Diego to New York , the plane experienced a burst compressed air line in the passenger cabin . Oxygen masks were deployed , and the plane made an emergency descent and landing in Palm Springs . Vigoda and five other passengers were listed as " slightly injured. " . Mr. Vigoda now resides in Riverdale , in the northwest Bronx . In 2002 , Galcik recorded a gothic rock song Abe Vigoda 's Dead , a parody of Bela Lugosi 's Dead by Bauhaus . In 2004 , programmer Bob Vesterman released the Abe Vigoda Status extension for the Mozilla Firefox web browser , so the user 's Firefox status bar would display whether Vigoda was alive or dead . The extension 's humor made it a common pick as journalists described the new field of browser extensions and it became quite popular , especially after being posted on the website Fark.com . The ensuing traffic briefly crashed Vesterman 's website . As of 2006 , updates of the extension are no longer available and currently installed versions no longer work . The website to the computer game They Came From Hollywood , a game known for its constant delays , uses Abe Vigoda 's status as a way to tell fans whether development of the game has been cancelled or not .
