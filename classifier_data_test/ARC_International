ARC International plc ( traded on the London Stock Exchange , under ticker symbol ARK ) is the developer of configurable processor technology . ARC licenses configurable CPU / DSP processors and multimedia subsystems . The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990 's . Originally Argonaut RISC Core , it was a hardware design division of Argonaut Software , which designed a configurable microprocessor core for use in embedded applications . One of the first uses was in 1993 for the Super FX chip used in Super Nintendo video games . It was spun - off as a separate company in 1998 . As part of Argonaut , a software provider to game companies , the design team developed customized microprocessors . The technology to create customized designs evolved into the ARChitectÂ™ configurator tool . ARC 's products are used by ~140 customers that collectively ship about 200 million ARC - Based chips every year to embedded markets . ARC International employs approximately 130 people in research and development , sales and marketing offices across North America , Europe and Asia . The firm has two main lines of products : configurable processors ( e.g. the ARC 600 and ARC 700 families ) and media subsystems . The processors are described as configurable . What this means in reality is that not only can they have certain aspects " configured " in and out , for example an MMU , or a complex multiplier , but also that they can be extended . Extended means that they can have custom instructions , registers and condition codes added which will then form part of the basic ISA for the extended processor . The media subsystems cover audio and video applications .
