The Boston Garden was a famous arena built in 1928 in Boston , Massachusetts . Designed by boxing promoter Tex Rickard , who also built the third incarnation of New York 's Madison Square Garden , the arena was originally called the " Boston Madison Square Garden " , but eventually got clipped to the Boston Garden . Located on top of North Station , a train station , which is a hub for MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak trains , the Garden hosted home games for the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics , as well as rock concerts , amateur sports , boxing and wrestling cards , circuses and ice shows . It was also used as an exposition hall for political rallies such as the famous speech by John F. Kennedy in November , 1960 . The Boston Garden was demolished in 1998 , a few years after the completion of its new successor arena , the FleetCenter , now called TD Banknorth Garden . Tex Rickard built the arena specifically with boxing in mind , believing that every seat should be close enough to see the " sweat on the boxers ' brows. " . Because of this design theme , when the larger hockey and basketball playing areas were used , fans were much closer to the players than in most arenas , leading to a distinct hometown advantage . The closeness also created spectacular acoustic effects ; one legendary story had a lone fan , sitting in the cheapest seats in the arena , harranguing Bruins player Ed Westfall from across the length of the ice , and Westfall turning and giving him " the finger " . When teams made playoff appearances , and a sold out crowd was chanting or screaming , the impact was enormous ; even the notoriously loud Chicago Stadium could not match the noise of the smaller Garden . The change from the Garden to the TD Banknorth Garden remarkably coincided with the demise in popularity and success of both the Bruins and the Celtics with local fans . Sections of the famous parquet floor and bricks of the garden were sold as souvenirs following its demolition . The Garden was also famous for its parquet floor that the Boston Celtics played on ; however , the parquet floor was not originally part of the Garden . The parquet floor was built and installed in the Boston Arena , but was moved to the Garden in 1952 . It is said that the Celtics knew which way the basketball would bounce off any particular section of the floor , and that this was one contributing factor to the Celtics ' many National Basketball Association championships . The floor became as much a part of Boston sports lore as the Green Monster of Fenway Park . The parquet floor was used until December 22 , 1999 , at the FleetCenter . Portions of the original floor are integrated with new parquet . The floor was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs of the original Boston Garden . Seats from the Boston Garden were also sold . The Naden overhead scoreboard ( which was electro - mechanical , not electronic , as more recent arenas used ) of the Boston Garden can be seen hanging in the Boston Garden themed foodcourt of the Arsenal Mall in Watertown MA .
