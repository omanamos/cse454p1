Alida Valli ( 31 May , 1921 â€“ 22 April , 2006 ) , sometimes simply credited as Valli , was an Italian actress . She was christened Alida Maria Laura von Altenburger , Baroness of Marckenstein and Frauenberg of the The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation . At 15 years old she went to Rome , where she attended the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia , a school for film actors and directors . At that time she lived at her uncle 's , the Roman senator Ettore Tolomei . Beautiful , elegant and talented ( with a sensual and melancholic glance ) , Alida Valli started her movie career in 1934 , in Il cappello a tre punte ( The Three Cornered Hat ) . The first big success came with the movie Mille lire al mese . After many roles in a large number of comedies , she could prove her dramatic talent in Piccolo mondo antico ( 1941 ) , directed by Mario Soldati . During the War Years she starred in many movies , like Stasera niente di nuovo ( 1942 ) and Noi Vivi - Addio Kira ! ( 1943 ) , and became a movie star . Alida Valli had a career in English language films through David Selznick , who signed her to a contract , thinking that he had found a second Ingrid Bergman . In Hollywood she performed in several movies : she was the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock 's The Paradine Case ( 1947 ) , and the mysterious Czech refugee wanted by the Russians in post - war Vienna in Carol Reed 's The Third Man ( 1949 ) . But her foreign experience was not a great success due to the financial problems of Selznick 's production company . In the early 1950s she came back to Europe , and starred in many French and Italian films . In 1954 she had a great success in the melodramatic Senso , directed by Luchino Visconti . In that film , set in mid - 1800s Venice during the Risorgimento , she was a Venetian countess torn between nationalistic feelings and an adulterous love for an officer ( played by Farley Granger ) of the occupying Austrian forces . Her performance was vivid and passionate . Her movie career suffered as a result of the infamous Wilma Montesi scandal , in which her lover and jazz musician Piero Piccioni ( the son of the Italian minister of foreign affairs ) was involved together with Maurizio d'Assia ( Moritz von Hessen ) , the son of the famous Italian princess Mafalda di Savoia . In 1959 , she appeared in Georges Franju 's horror masterpiece Les Yeux sans visage ( Eyes Without a Face ) . From the 1960s she worked in several pictures with great directors , like Pier Paolo Pasolini ( Edipo re , Oedipus Rex , 1967 ) , Bernardo Bertolucci ( La strategia del ragno , 1972 ; Novecento , 1976 ) and Dario Argento ( Suspiria , 1977 ) . Her last movie appearance was in Semana Santa ( 2002 ) , with Mira Sorvino . In Italy , she was also well - known for her stage appearances in such plays as Ibsen 's Rosmersholm ; Pirandello 's Henry IV ; John Osborne 's Epitaph for George Dillon ; and Arthur Miller 's A View from the Bridge . Her death at her home on April 22 , 2006 , was announced by the office of the mayor of Rome
