A Vindication of the Rights of Men was a defense of the ideals of the French Revolution , written by the English Mary Wollstonecraft in 1790 in response to Edmund Burke 's conservative objections to the Revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France . She argued that the situation for women could be compared to the situation of slaves , and accused Tom Paine of focusing too little on the rights of all people , not just men . A Vindication of the Rights of Men was written against the tumultuous background of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain . In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war , now referred to as the " Revolution Controversy , " British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state . Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men , a response to Edmund Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) . In his Reflections , Burke criticizes the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution . While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain 's own Glorious Revolution in 1688 , which had restricted the powers of the monarchy , Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English civil war ( 1642 - 1651 ) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649 , because he viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government . In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to overthrow their government ; because civilization , including governments , is the result of social and political consensus , its traditions cannot be challenged—the result would be endless anarchy . One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft 's Rights of Men , published just six weeks after Burke 's Reflections , is that rights cannot be based on tradition ; rights , she argues , should be conferred because they are reasonable and just , regardless of their basis in tradition . She points out that Burke 's system would logically lead to the continuation of slavery simply because it had been an ancestral tradition . But Wollstonecraft was not just responding to Burke 's Reflections ; she was also responding to his A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful ( 1756 ) , in which he argues that the beautiful is associated with weakness and femininity and that the sublime is associated with strength and masculinity . Wollstonecraft turns Burke 's rhetoric in the Reflections against him ; she argues that his theatrical staging , such as the famous scene in which he describes in florid prose the horrors Marie Antoinette had to undergo , turns Burke 's readers — the citizens — into weak women who are swayed by show . She further critiques Burke 's argument by focusing on class , demonstrating , like many other critics of Burke , that while he was moved by Marie Antoinette 's suffering he was unmoved by the plight of the poor , starving women in France ; indeed , he is openly hostile to them . Wollstonecraft does not reject the need for sympathy in human relations that Burke emphasizes , but she often argues that sympathy is insufficient for social cohesion , at one point writing , " Such misery demands more than tears — I pause to recollect myself
