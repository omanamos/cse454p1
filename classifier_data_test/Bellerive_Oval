Bellerive Oval is a sports ground in Bellerive , eastern shore of Hobart , Tasmania , Australia . It is best known as the home ground for the state cricket team , the Tasmanian Tigers , and as a host ground for international Test and one - day matches . Bellerive Oval is the only ground in Tasmania to host Test cricket . Football and cricket first started being played in the area where Bellerive Oval is now in the mid to late 1800s . In 1884 the first football match on record from the area was played between Carlton and Bellerive . In 1913 the piece of land located between the now Beach , Church and Derwent streets was sold to the Clarence council. 1 year later , the new Bellerive recreation ground was ready for use . The ground barely changed from then until the mid ' 80s . During this time the ground had a hump in the centre of the ground made only the top half of players visible from the other side of the ground . There was a shed for players located where the main pavilion now stands . There was a hill on the outer ( where the hill now is ) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles , the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now , and the time clock sat about halfway up a training light tower . The police booth sat , until very recently , in the north - east corner of the oval . A concrete cricket pitch served for local junior teams until the 1956 / 57 season , when it was replaced by a turf wicket . In 1948 The Clarence Football Club , a tennant of the ground , applied to join the Tasmanian Football League , and the ground had to upgrade to TFL standards . Some minor upgrades were made in the 1960s , clubrooms were built in 1961 , and in 1963 a small grandstand ( seating about 500 ) and a new PA system were installed . In 1977 , Tasmania gained admission into the Sheffield Shield and a plan was put in place by the TCA to move from its headquarters at the TCA Ground on the Domain to a new oval . Bellerive Oval was chosen ahead of KGV Oval and North Hobart Oval . The newly refurbished ground was opened in 1986 for a TFL Statewide League roster match between Clarence and Hobart , 3562 - people attended the match which saw a Clarence victory . However , significant damage to the newly laid turf which saw an enormous amounts of divets in the playing surface , no more football matches were scheduled at the ground for the remainder of the 1986 TFL season.The move was made in 1987 under TCA Chairman Denis Rogers , in time for its first international match - between Sri Lanka and New Zealand on January 12 , 1988 , before a crowd of 6,500 . The first test match in Tasmania was played at Bellerive from the 16th - 20th of December , 1989 , between Australia and Sri Lanka . Shortly afterwards , the new electronic scoreboard and Northern Stand was erected . In 2007 , Bellerive Oval was the ground at which the Tasmanian Tigers won their inaugeral Pura Cup victory .
