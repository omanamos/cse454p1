Aeronca , located in Middletown , Ohio , is a manufacturer of engine components and airframe structures for commercial aviation and the defense industry . In the 1930s and 1940s , the company was a major producer of general aviation aircraft , and also produced the engines for some of their early designs . The Aeronca Aircraft Corporation was founded November 11 , 1928 in Cincinnati , Ohio . Backed by the financial and political support of the prominent Taft family—future Ohio senator Robert A. Taft was one of the firm 's directors—Aeronca became the first company to build a commercially successful general aviation aircraft , and by the time production ended in 1951 Aeronca had sold 17,408 aircraft in 55 models . Production began with the Jean A. Roche - designed Aeronca C - 2 monoplane , often called the Flying Bathtub , in 1929 . The next major model was the Scout of 1937 , a two - seater , which was developed into the famous Chief and Super Chief the next year . In 1937 there was a massive flood at the Lunken Airport , resulting in the entire airport area being washed away . Water was almost as deep as the control tower . Aeronca 's factory was destroyed , along with the tooling and almost all of the very early blueprints and drawings . At this time a decision was made to move the entire operation to a more stable area . Middletown Ohio was chosen and the company has remained there ever since . All of the airplanes produced from the start of production in 1929 to 1937 are known as the " Lunken " Aeronca 's and the airplanes produced after spring 1937 are known as the " Middletown " Aeronca 's . The Defender , a tandem trainer version of the Chief with a higher rear seat , was used in training many of the pilots who flew in World War II . Several observation and liaison aircraft designs were also produced during and after the war , including the L - 3 , L - 16 , and O - 58 . In 1945 , following the close of World War II , Aeronca returned to civilian production with two new models , the 7AC Champion or Champ and the 11AC Chief . While the Champ shared its tandem seating arrangement with the pre - war tandem trainer and the Chief shared its name with the pre - war Chief designs , both were new designs . A benefit of the concurrent development was that the new airplanes had about 80 % of their parts in common . Between the designs , the Champ was favored by the public , evidenced by its outselling its sibling at a rate of 4 to 1. Between 1945 and 1951 , nearly 8,000 Champions were sold ; over the same period , something over 2,000 Chiefs . Aeronca ceased light aircraft production in 1951 , and in 1954 sold the Champion design to the new Champion Aircraft Corporation of Osceola , Wisconsin , which continued building variants of the Champion as well as the derivative design , the Citabria . Aeronca now builds components for aerospace companies including Boeing , Northrop , Lockheed , and Airbus . National Aeronca Association , associated with the factory .
