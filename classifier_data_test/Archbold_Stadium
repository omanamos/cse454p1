Archbold Stadium was a multi - purpose stadium in Syracuse , New York . It opened in 1907 and was home to the Syracuse University Orange football team prior to the Carrier Dome opening in 1980 . It was the third concrete football stadium built in the country . The stadium was named for John D. Archbold , who donated $600,000 for the project . He was also responsible for funding towards the building of Archbold Gymnasium , located just to the east overlooking the stadium . The 800 ' x 475 ' stadium was oval - shaped , with a track ( originally dirt ) and a natural grass football stadium . The west end zone , the stadium 's main entrance , was marked by a grand castle - like fa√ßade with turrets framing the gateway arch . There was originally a wooden roof over the central section of the south grandstands for the reserved seating . In the 1950s , the building was expanded to the north and south , bringing the capacity up to 40,000 . However , by the 1970s , the building 's capacity was lowered to approximately 26,000 due to fire codes . This proved to be the stadium 's undoing . It was closed following the 1978 season , to be razed for the building of the Carrier Dome , which , coincidentally , is approximately 230 feet shorter than the stadium . In the final game at Archbold Stadium , on November 11 , 1978 , the Orangemen defeated nationally ranked Navy , 20 - 17 . During its history , Syracuse compiled a 265 - 112 - 20 record at Archbold .
