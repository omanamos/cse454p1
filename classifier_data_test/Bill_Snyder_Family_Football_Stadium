Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium is a stadium in Manhattan , Kansas . It is used solely for American football , and is the home field of the Kansas State University Wildcats . Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium opened as KSU Stadium in 1968 , with a capacity of 35,000 . It was the replacement for Memorial Stadium , which hosted Kansas State football games since 1922 ( and is still standing today ) . The first game played at the new stadium was on September 21 , 1968 ; Kansas State beat the Colorado State Rams 21 - 0 . In 1970 , 4,000 permanent bleacher seats were added to the east side and 3,000 temporary seats on the west side . Also that year , an AstroTurf playing field was installed in place of natural grass . Prior to the 1991 season , a new AstroTurf surface was installed and the playing field was named " Wagner Field " for the Dave and Carol Wagner family of Dodge City , Kansas . In 1993 , on its 25th anniversary , KSU Stadium saw its first significant additions â€” a five - level press box and luxury suites on the west side of the field . After the 1998 season , the stadium underwent another expansion , a $12.8 million USD project designed by HOK Sport that increased the official capacity to 50,300 and added an upper deck on the east grandstands , club seating , and more luxury suites . Prior to the 2002 season , the artificial turf was updated to a more cushioned FieldTurf surface at a cost of $800,000 . Before the final game of the 2005 season , KSU Stadium was renamed in honor of the retiring head coach Bill Snyder , who had led the team for 17 years . Snyder had turned the Wildcats , once among the worst college football teams , into a frequent championship contender in the Big 12 Conference . In 2006 , another $5.6 million was used to renovate the locker - room complex and add new north end zone seating , raising the permanent seating capacity . The renovation includes new audio and visual electronics and a new hydrotherapy center . From 1996 to 2000 , Kansas State won 26 consecutive games on its home field . This is the 25th - longest home winning streak in NCAA history . On August 31 , 1996 , the stadium hosted the first football game in Big 12 Conference history , as Kansas State defeated Texas Tech University 21 - 14 , amid pomp and ceremony , including a skydiver delivering the first conference game ball . Kansas State 's 100th game at Snyder Stadium was a 14 - 21 loss to Iowa State University on November 16 , 1985 . Kansas State 's 200th game at Snyder Stadium was a 40 - 7 win over Louisiana Tech on November 17 , 2001 . The stadium has hosted several Kansas high school football State Championship contests and Kansas Shrine Bowl games .
