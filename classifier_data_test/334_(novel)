Cover of 1999 paperback edition , published by Vintage . 334 is a science fiction novel by Thomas M. Disch , written in 1972 . It is a gritty , subtly dystopian look at everyday life in New York City around the year 2025 . Most of the novel 's characters live in a huge housing project at 334 East 11th Street , in Manhattan . The title also refers to the year 334 CE , during the later years of the Roman Empire ; numerous comparisons are made between the decline of Rome and the future of the United States . The future in 334 has brought few technological advances except for new medical techniques and recreational drugs . There have been no dramatic disasters , but overpopulation has made housing and other resources scarce ; the response is a program of compulsory birth control and eugenics . A welfare state provides for basic needs through an all - encompassing agency called MODICUM , but there is an extreme class division between welfare recipients and professionals . The novel consists of five independent novellas ( previously published separately ) with a common setting but different characters , and a longer sub - novel called " 334 " whose many short sections trace the members of a single family forward and backward in time . Their task is complicated by the desire of some patients to be cryonically preserved for a better future . Mrs. Hanson : An elderly widow living at 334 . Mother to Lottie , Shrimp , and Boz . Lottie Hanson : An unemployed single mother living at 334 . Shrimp Hanson : Considered genetically desirable for her unusual intelligence , therefore has a free pass from the government to have children , although she is actually motivated by a fetish for artificial insemination . Boz Hanson : Unemployed , former resident of 334 , managed to leave by marrying Milly . Milly Holt : A professional sex demonstrator for the high schools . Was Birdie 's girlfriend , now married to Boz . Ab Holt : Manages the morgue at Bellevue Hospital . Birdie Ludd : A high - school student living at 334 . Frances Schaap : A prostitute living at 334 . Like many people in the 2020s , she has lupus . Alexa : A MODICUM administrator , responsible for the Hansons . Tancred : Alexa 's son . Amparo : Lottie 's daughter . Little Mister Kissy Lips : Son of a television executive , classmate of Tancred and Amparo . Like much of Disch 's fiction , 334 is both a prediction of future trends and a satirical portrait of the contemporary United States . Its bureaucratic city - state is an exaggeration of aspects of liberal programs that began in the 1960s , combining their best hopes ( material need has been eliminated ) with the worst suspicions of their detractors ( the lower class remains uneducated and without aspirations ; their social workers mostly regard them with contempt ) . Its portrayal of other forms of social change is similarly ambiguous : same - sex relationships gain acceptance , but suffer the same pathologies as traditional ones ; sexual frankness ( and free TV pornography ) does not relieve neurosis ; the intellectual pursuits of the professional class devolve into endless solipsistic therapy . The only institution that the characters feel some loyalty to is the nuclear family . Political action is touched on only indirectly in the novel ; most of the characters are so politically uninvolved
