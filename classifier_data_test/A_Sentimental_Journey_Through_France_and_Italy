A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy is a novel by Irish author Laurence Sterne , written and first published in 1768 , as Sterne was facing death . In 1765 Laurence Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples , and after returning determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view . The novel can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy , Gentleman , and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett 's decidedly unsentimental Travels through France and Italy . The novel was extremely popular and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the second half of the 18th century . Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical learning and objective non - personal points of view , A Sentimental Journey emphasized the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments , of manners and morals over classical learning . Throughout the 1770 's women travel writers began publishing significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts . Sentiment also became a favorite style among those expressing non - mainstream views including political radicalism . The narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick , who is slyly represented to guileless readers as Sterne 's barely disguised alter ego . The book recounts his various adventures , usually of the amorous type , in a series of self - contained episodes . The book is less eccentric and more elegant in style than Tristram Shandy and was received better by contemporary critics . It was published on February 27 , and on March 18 Sterne died .
