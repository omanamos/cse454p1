Coors Field , located in Denver , Colorado is the home field of the National League 's Colorado Rockies . It is named for the Coors Brewing Company of Golden , Colorado , which purchased the naming rights to the park prior to its completion in 1995 . The Rockies played their first two seasons , 1993 and 1994 , in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field , two blocks from Union Station in Denver 's Lower Downtown ( or LoDo ) neighborhood . The park includes 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats . Coors Field has a reputation as a home run - friendly park that , arguably , equals Chicago 's venerable Wrigley Field , and earned it the nickname " Coors Canaveral " among critics ( a reference to Cape Canaveral , from where NASA launches spacecraft ) . Denver 's dry air tends to dry out baseballs , which makes the balls harder and travel farther . Other factors include the relatively low height of the fences and very limited foul territory area . While it is commonly believed that Denver 's high altitude results in lower air pressure , the relative dryness of the air actually make the atmosphere less dense than may other stadiums with more humidity . Due to the perception that that the area 's high altitude would lead to numerous home runs , The Rockies deliberately moved the fences farther away as a result . Ironically , this created a ballpark that not only gives up the most home runs in baseball , but also gives up the most doubles and triples as well . Coors Field was the first new stadium added in a six year period in which Denver 's sports venues were upgraded , along with the Pepsi Center and INVESCO Field at Mile High stadium . As with the other new venues , Coors Field was constructed with accessibility in mind . It sits near Interstate 25 and has direct access to the 20th Street and Park Avenue exits . Nearby Union Station also provides light rail access . Coors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller , seating only 43,800 . However , after the Rockies drew almost 4.5 million people in their first season - - the most in baseball history - - plans were altered during construction , and new seats , mostly in the center field bleacher section , were added . This section has its own informal name : " the Rockpile. " . While most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green , the seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple . This marks the city 's one mile elevation point . The only no - hitter at Coors Field was thrown by Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 17 , 1996 . Another game of note was the 1998 MLB All - Star Game . Alan Roach was the main PA announcer since Coors Field opened in 1995 . In the spring preceding the 2007 Rockies season , Roach announced his retirement from his post at Coors Field to spend more time over the summer with his family . Roach is also the PA announcer for the nearby Colorado Avalanche and provides voice - overs for local sports introductions in the region , in addition to hosting a local sports talk radio show . Reed Saunders , 23 , was chosen to be the new voice of Coors Field on March 16 , 2007 .
