In 1992 , Robert Redford directed a film of the same name starring Brad Pitt , Craig Sheffer , Tom Skerritt , Brenda Blethyn , and Emily Lloyd . It was nominated for three Academy Awards and Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for his cinematography . Not surprisingly , the film fueled a dramatic rise in fly - fishing 's popularity : the fly fishing industry expanded roughly three - fold in the five years following the film 's release . This rapid expansion of the sport was a mixed bag , both for die - hard fisherfolk and for the fish . On the one side , many new technologies and refinements were brought to bear on ancient equipment and methods ; fly - fishermen are gadget freaks by nature , so this was generally enjoyable . However , the well - known rivers also became very crowded with novices , and some ecosystems suffered . Both the unspoiled natural places and the contemplative state of mind portrayed in Maclean 's book ( and the film ) became harder to find .
