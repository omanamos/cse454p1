Aasmund Olavsson Vinje ( April 6 , 1818 - July 30 , 1870 ) was a famous Norwegian poet and journalist who is remembered for poetry , travel writing , and his pioneering use of Landsmål ( now known as Nynorsk ) . Vinje was born into a poor but well - read family in Vinje , Telemark . He had a voracious appetite for learning and supported himself in part by teaching . He earned his university entrance exam after attending the same school as Henrik Ibsen , studied law , and became an attorney . He founded the periodical Dølen ( The dales - man ) in 1858 , in which he published travel accounts , and editorial comments on art , language and politics that serve as records for the period in which he lived . The Dølen ceased plication in 1870 . Vinje did much to articulate the difference between city and rural life in Norway and was among the sophisticated exponents of Norwegian romantic nationalism . Despite this , he was also know for his critical scepticism and double views ( no : tvisyn ) - that is , he advocated to embrace both pro and contra arguments to avoid confirmation bias . He was politically active to the extent that the government fired him from his work as an attorney for criticizing its foreign policy . Among his writings , the Ferdaminni fraa Sumaren 1860 ( A remembrance of a voyage in the summer 1860 , not translated ) , rank in high esteem in norwegian literature , describing a journey from Oslo to Trondheim in order to cover the coronation of king Charles in the Nidarosdomen cathedral for his periodical . It can be seen as a program for Vinje and the Dølen that the description deals more warm - hearted with his meetings with ordinary people along the journey , than with the royalities he encountered at the coronation . In 1863 he wrote A Norseman 's View of Britain and the British , which was translated into Norwegian ten years later . Some of Vinje 's poetry is still very much alive in Norway , especially the poem Ved Rundane ( English At Rondane ) , with its tune by Edvard Grieg . Dying from stomach cancer , Vinje decided to spend his last days in the countryside . He died as a guest of his friend , minister ( later bishop ) A. Chr . Bang in Gran in Hadeland on July 30 , 1870 and is buried nearby at Søsterkirkene ( " Sister Churches " ) .
