A Legend of Montrose is an historical novel by Sir Walter Scott , set in Scotland in the 1640s during the Civil War . It forms , along with The Bride of Lammermoor , the 3rd series of Scott 's Tales of My Landlord . The two novels were published together in 1819 . The story takes place during the Earl of Montrose 's 1644 - 5 Highland campaign on behalf of King Charles I against the Covenanters who had sided with the English Parliament in the English Civil War . The main plot concerns a love triangle between Allan M'Aulay , his friend the Earl of Menteith , and Annot Lyle . Annot is a young woman who has been brought up by the M'Aulays since being captured as a girl during a blood feud against the MacEagh clan ( also known as the Children of the Mist ) . M'Aulay and Menteith are both members of Montrose 's army . Annot eventually marries Menteith after it is discovered that she has aristocratic blood , and was kidnapped by the MacEaghs as a baby . This leads to the jealous M'Aulay stabbing Menteith and then fleeing Montrose 's army . Menteith survives whilst M'Aulay disappears and is rumoured to have been killed by the MacEaghs . Much of the novel is taken up with a subplot involving an expedition into enemy territory by Dugald Dalgetty , an experienced mercenary fighting for Montrose . Dalgetty does not fight out of political or religious conviction , but purely for the love of carnage . However , he is very professional , and remains loyal to an employer to the end of his contract . He gained his experience fighting for various armies during the Thirty Years ' War , then still raging in Germany . Note : He did not fight all thirty years . Dalgetty is regarded as one of Scott 's finest comic characters , however he dominates so much of the story that the main plot is not really developed in detail .
