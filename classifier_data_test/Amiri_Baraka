Amiri Baraka ( born October 7 , 1934 ) is an American writer of poetry , drama , essays and music criticism . Baraka was born Everett LeRoy Jones in Newark , New Jersey . His father , Colt LeRoy Jones , worked as a postman and lift operator , and his mother , Anna Lois , was a social worker . In 1952 he changed his name to LeRoi Jones . In 1967 he adopted the African name Imamu Ameer Baraka , which he later changed to Amiri Baraka . Baraka studied philosophy and religious studies at Rutgers University , Columbia University and Howard University without obtaining a degree . In 1954 he joined the US Air Force reaching the rank of sergeant . After an anonymous letter to his commanding officer accusing him of being a communist led to the discovery of Soviet writings , Baraka was put on gardening duty and given a dishonorable discharge for violation of his oath of duty . The same year he moved to Greenwich Village working initially in a warehouse for music records . From this period stems his interest in jazz . At the same time he came into contact with the incipient movement of Beat Poets that was going to have a powerful influence on his early poetry . In 1958 , Jones founded Totem Press , which published such Beat icons as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg . The same year he married Hettie Cohen and with her became joint editor of the Yugen literary magazine ( until 1963 ) . In 1960 he went to Cuba , a visit that initiated his transformation into a politically active artist . In 1961 Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note was published , followed in 1963 by Blues People : Negro Music in White America - to this day one of the most influential volumes of jazz criticism , especially in regard to the then beginning Free Jazz movement . His play Dutchman premiered in 1964 and the same year he won an Obie Award for it.After the killing of Malcolm X he broke with the Beat Poets , left his wife and their two children and moved to Harlem because , at the time , he thought of himself as a black cultural nationalist . Hettie Cohen , later , in her autobiography How I Became Hettie Jones ( 1996 ) , claimed that Baraka had mistreated her during the time of their marriage . In 1966 Baraka married his second wife who later adopted the name Amina Baraka . In 1967 he became a lecturer at San Francisco State University . In 1968 he was arrested in Newark for illegally carrying a weapon and resisting arrest during riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King and sentenced to three years in prison . Shortly afterwards an appeal court threw out the sentence . The same year his second book of jazz criticism Black Music came out , a collection of previously published music journalism , including the seminal Apple Cores columns from Down Beat magazine . In 1970 he strongly supported Kenneth Gibson 's candidacy for mayor of Newark ; Gibson was elected the city 's first Afro - American Mayor . In the late 1960s and early 1970s Baraka courted controversy by penning some strongly anti - Jewish poems and articles , similar to the then stance of the Nation of Islam . Around 1974 Baraka distanced himself from Black nationalism and became a Marxist and a supporter of anti - imperialist third world liberation movements
