A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is a novel written by Michael Dorris and published in 1987 . It is written from the viewpoints of three people , Rayona , Christine , and Ida , exchanging viewpoints between different sections of the book . The book is divided explicitly into three sections , titled Rayona , Christine , and Ida , respectively . From the start , the reader is given evidence that the protagonists of this novel are not involved in what we would consider a typical , contented American family . Christine and Rayona foster a relationship which contains definitive signs of dependency and bonding between the two of them , though this is largely offset by Christine 's neglectful and erratic tendencies toward Rayona . Christine is a chronic alcoholic and frequently abuses an amalgam of other drugs , including Percocet ( a highly addictive painkiller ) . The book opens in the Indian Health Service hospital in Seattle , during a card game between Rayona and Christine . Rayona knows that Christine is cheating , and Christine expectedly wins the game . Pressed for another round , Christine declines . In an article from the Alan Review , Frances Nadeau notes , " In other novels , the mother is absent emotionally , often as a result of alcohol or drug dependency . In Taking the Ferry Home , wealthy and sophisticated Simone suffers from her mother 's addiction to both alcohol and drugs . The mothers ' emotional dependence often requires that the daughters assume the role of " mother " in that they make decisions and assume responsibility. " . Elgin arrives at the hospital a short time after the opening exchange , and he gives Rayona the keys to Christine 's Plymouth Volaré , which he had borrowed . Christine is furious at Elgin . Elgin leaves , and Rayona heads to the car in the parking lot . She arrives to find the car damaged and parked improperly , but more surprising is that Christine is breaking into the car with a coat hanger . We owe two months back rent on that lousy apartment . My unemployment is expired and I'm tired of finding two - bit jobs . I'm past forty years old and my husband wants to ditch me and marry some Arletta . I figure I've wore out my welcome in this world and the only thing I've got that 's worth anything is the insurance on this fucking car . So it 's going to have a little accident and you're going to win the lottery . Kiss me good - bye. " . Rayona is quick to prevent her mother from performing this atrocity ; this leads to a sudden change of heart on Christine 's part . After a trip to a video rental store where Christine rents the movies Christine and Little Big Man , they continue to Aunt Ida 's house in Montana , where the Volaré almost makes it to the house before it dies . Aunt Ida confronts Christine , who suddenly curses Aunt Ida and leaves Rayona to Christine . After Rayona is separated from her mother — abandoned in unfamiliar territory and unsuccessful at first in befriending allies — she steadily becomes more reliant on her own determination and persistence in order to maintain the healthiest possible existence under the conditions she has been subjected to . Aunt Ida ignores Rayona , sitting in front of her teleivsion all day and talking to it . Rayona also meets Father
