ASUSTeK Computer Inc. ( Chinese : 華碩電腦股份有限公司 ) is a Taiwan - based company that produces motherboards , graphics cards , optical drives , PDAs , notebook computers , networking products , mobile phones , computer cases , computer components and computer cooling systems . Commonly called by their brand name ASUS ( pronounced ) it is listed on London Stock Exchange and Taiwan Stock Exchange . ASUS was founded in 1989 in Taiwan by TH Tung , Ted Hsu , Wayne Hsieh and MT Liao - all four were computer engineers from Acer . The current CEO and Chairman of ASUS , Jonney Shih , joined the company in 1994 . According to the ASUS sales manager Alexander Kim the name ASUS originated from Pegasus , the winged horse of Greek mythology . The first three letters of the word were dropped to give the resulting name a high position in alphabetical listings . In 2004 , ASUS was reported to sell more motherboards than three other leading companies combined , reaching 30 million . This number , however , includes rebranding contracts . In 2005 , shipments from ASUS , ECS , Gigabyte , and MSI totaled 104.86 million units . ASUS led with about 52 million units , followed by ECS with 20 million , MSI with 18 million and Gigabyte with 16.6 million . MSI revised its motherboard shipments from an estimate of 16.7 million units to 18 million , according to the company . ASUS also produces components for other corporations , including Sony ( PlayStation 2 ) , Apple Computer ( iPod , iPod Shuffle , MacBook ) , Alienware , Falcon Northwest , HP and Compaq . In the early 1990s , Taiwanese motherboard manufacturers had not yet established their leading positions in the computer hardware business . Any new Intel processors would have been supplied to better established companies like IBM first , and the Taiwanese companies would be forced to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes . When the Intel 486 first came out , the four ASUS founders decided to design their own 486 motherboard without having a 486 processor prototype on site , using only the technical details published by Intel and the experience they gained while making the 386 motherboards . When ASUS finalized their 486 motherboard prototype , they took it to Intel 's base in Taiwan for testing . Unsurprisingly , they were not formally greeted when they arrived . It turned out that Intel 's own 486 motherboard prototype had recently malfunctioned , and Intel 's engineers were still working on the solution . The ASUS founders exercised their experience with the 486 and had a look at Intel 's malfunctioning motherboard . Their solution worked , to the Intel engineers ' surprise . Intel then tested the ASUS prototype , which functioned perfectly . This marked the beginning of an informal relationship between the two companies - ASUS now receives Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors . September / October 2003 : debuts in the cellphone market with the J100 model . December 2005 : enters the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model , initially only available on the Taiwan market . March 9 2006 : ASUS is announced to be one of the producers of the first Microsoft Origami models , together with Samsung and Founder . Samsung and ASUS devices expected by April 2006 .
