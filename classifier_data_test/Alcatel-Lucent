The company does business in 132 countries , with almost equal sales distribution coming from both its European and North American regions , and an additional third of its channel located elsewhere in the world . Alcatel - Lucent was formed after the merger of Alcatel and Lucent Technologies on December 1 , 2006 . Headquartered in Paris ( France ) , rue de la Boétie , with significant operations in and around Paris , Alcatel has a long history beginning in 1898 with the founding of Compagnie Générale d'Electricité ( CGE ) . The original home of the company was the Alsace region and it still maintains R&D operations in the Strasbourg area . The current name , " Alcatel " , comes from the acquisition in 1968 of Société Alsacienne de Constructions Atomiques , de Télécommunications et d ' Electronique . In 1991 CGE changed its name to Alcatel Alsthom , and in 1998 to Alcatel . There were a number of mergers and acquisitions , as well as divestments since 1898 . To understand the current company and its focus on telecommunications , the most important were the acquisition of the European telecommunications activities of ITT in 1986 . The combined companies were called Alcatel Alsthom . Alcatel maintains significant R&D presence in France ( Paris region , Brittany , South of France ) , Antwerp ( Belgium ) , at the former ITT operations there ( Bell Telephone ) , in Stuttgart ( Germany ) , in Italy ( Vimercate , Genoa , Rieti , Trieste , Battipaglia ) , in India ( Gurgaon , NOIDA and Chennai ) , since 2000 in Shanghai ( China ) and since 2005 in Saint - Petersburg ( Russia ) . Since 1990 , various North American companies were acquired – Spatial Wireless , Rockwell Technologies , DSC Communications , Xylan , Packet Engines , Assured Access , Newbridge , iMagicTV , TiMetra , and eDial – giving Alcatel a strong U.S. and Canadian presence . Alcatel has its North American headquarters in Plano , Texas , and R&D operations in Ottawa , Ontario ; Mountain View , California ; Petaluma , California ; Saint John , New Brunswick ; Calabasas , California and Raleigh , North Carolina . Earlier this year , Alcatel set up a new joint venture with TCL of China forming a new mobile business , TCL and Alcatel Mobile Phones Limited ( TAMP ) . One of the primary reasons AT&T chose to spin off its equipment manufacturing business was to permit it to profit from sales to competing telecommunications providers ; these customers had previously shown reluctance at purchasing from a direct competitor . Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company , as well as the revenue from thousands of patents . At the time of its spinoff , Lucent was placed under the leadership of Henry Schacht , who was brought in to oversee its transition from an arm of AT&T into an independent corporation . Richard McGinn succeeded Schacht as CEO in 1997 . Lucent became a " darling " stock of the investment community in the late 1990s , rising from a split adjusted spin - off price of $7.56 / share to a high
