By the 21st century , the moon has been colonised , and is open to tourists who can afford the trip . Some of them are trapped after a lunar quake . By the 21st century , the moon has been colonised , and although still very much a research establishment , it is open to tourists who can afford the trip . One of its attractions is a " cruise " across one of the " Seas " that has filled over eons with very fine dust . The specially designed " boat " skims over the surface of the dust , which is so fine that it almost behaves like water . But on one cruise , a problem develops . A Moonquake causes an underground cavern to collapse , upsetting the equilibrium . As the dustcruiser Selene passes over , it sinks several metres below the surface of the dust . Their air supply is limited , there is no way for heat generated to escape , no communications are possible and no one quite sure where they are . The major problem for Captain Pat Harris and stewardess Sue Wilkins is to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable whilst waiting to be rescued . Fortunately , the passengers include several experienced scientists , and also a retired space ship captain and explorer , Commodore Hansteen . Chief Engineer ( Earthside ) Robert Lawrence is sceptical that a rescue can be mounted , even if the ' Selene ' can be located . He is ready to abandon an initially unsuccessful search , when he is contacted by Thomas Lawson , a brilliant but eccentric astronomer who , from his vantage point on a satellite high above the Moon , believes he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface . An expedition is organised and Lawrence indeed makes contact with Selene several metres below the dust surface . He now plans and sends out a rescue expedition . As the passengers wait and start to run out of air , the rescuers sink a metal tube to the ' Selene ' and cut a hole in the roof . With only seconds to go before Selene 's LOX finally explodes , the passengers are able to climb out into the waiting rescue craft . A short sequel sees Lawrence writing his memoirs , Pat and Sue married and Pat hoping to transfer to the space service . Russian : " Лунная пыль " ( " Moondust " ) , first edition 1965 .
