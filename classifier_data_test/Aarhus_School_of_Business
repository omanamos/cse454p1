The Aarhus School of Business is a university in Aarhus , Denmark . It offers both undergraduate and graduate level studies in areas such as Business , Management , Economics , Language , and Law . From 2007 - 1 - 1 it is part of Aarhus University . On September 15 2004 , Aarhus School of Business ( ASB ) celebrated its 65th anniversary . However , ASB 's predecessor , The Jutland Business School ( Den Jyske Handelshøjskole , DJH ) , has a somewhat more extensive history . Already in the late 1800s DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to take an education within business , economics and trade . Only when ASB was founded in 1939 did it become the academic institution that it is known as today . Since the founding of ASB more than 65 years ago , it has grown and kept growing . In 1968 ASB moved from the original location downtown Århus to the yellow brick buildings which since then have provided the setting for the outstanding research and teaching ASB stands for . Today ASB is an EQUIS accredited business school , it has more than 7,000 students ( a significant number of which are international students ) and about 450 employees . ASB is also known for its student bar / disco , Klubben , which basically means ' The Club ' . On weekdays Klubben is the school 's main socializing area , but on Thursday it 's a different story . It 's packed with students , and the atmosphere is amazing - cheap beers and drinks are of course a big plus . Klubben has the largest turnover in sales of alcohol of any club in Denmark on any given thursday night . Check Out the website # REDIRECT ] for pictures from the thursday in " klubben " . Klubben is one of the business units of Studenterlauget , the one student union in Denmark with most people employed .
