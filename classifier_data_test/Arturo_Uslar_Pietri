Arturo Uslar Pietri ( May 16,1906 – February 26,2001 ) Was one of the most prominent Venezuelan figures of the twentieth century . He was a writer and an intellectual , who made important contributions as an educator , journalist , diplomat , politician and government official . Born in Caracas , Uslar Pietri was raised partly there and partly in Maracay ( State of Aragua ) where he published several short stories in youth magazines . He studied Political Science in the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas and shortly after moved to Paris as a member of the Venezuelan diplomatic delegation there . In Paris he met many Latin American writers and became a good friend of Alejo Carpentier and Miguel Ángel Asturias . One of his most celebrated books was written during his stay in France . In 1931 he published Las Lanzas Coloradas a historical novel set in revolutionary Venezuela . When the 27 year long dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez ended with the Dictator 's death in 1935 , Uslar Pietri became very active in the political debate , writing opinion articles in the local press . One of those articles , published on July 14 , 1936 included a phrase that is still remembered and has both become an inspiration and a recrimination of Venezuela 's fate as an oil producer and exporter . The title of that article was Sembrar el petróleo ( to sow or plant oil ) a metaphor he created to encourage Venezuelan leaders to invest oil wealth on sustainable growth . In 1939 , at the age of 33 he married Isabel Braun Kerdel with whom he had two sons , Arturo and Federico Uslar Braun ( both deceased ) . That same year he became Minister of Education . Founded a political party Partido Democrático Venezolano and joined the Legislative Assembly as a Deputy in 1944 . In 1945 he had been appointed Minister of the Interior . Political turmoil forced him to leave the country and move to New York in 1948 to come back two years later and resume his political activities as a Senator . During his stay in New York he taught at Columbia University . In 1963 he ran for the Venezuelan Presidency as a third party candidate but was defeated by Raúl Leoni . After this defeat , he stayed active in politics as a Senator but gradually distanced himself from the political fray . He became Director of the Caracas news daily El Nacional from 1969 to 1974 , when he traveled to Paris as Venezuelan Ambassador at UNESCO . On his return in 1979 , he concentrated on writing and education .
