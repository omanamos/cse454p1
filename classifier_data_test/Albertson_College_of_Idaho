Albertson College of Idaho is a liberal arts college with an enrollment of approximately 800 students located in Caldwell , Idaho . The college marks its beginning six years before Idaho 's statehood when the Presbyterian Church 's Wood River Presbytery , meeting in Shoshone , formed a commission to examine the possibility of establishing a Presbyterian college somewhere in the Idaho Territory . The commission found support for such a venture and in 1890 the Presbytery accepted an offer from a group of Caldwell citizens , led by William Judson Boone , to locate the institution in that community . The college was founded in 1891 by Dr. Rev. William Judson Boone with the support of the Wood River Presbytery . It first opened its doors to students on October 7 , 1891 . Nineteen students showed up at the College of Idaho for the first classes in 1891 . The first classes were held downtown in the Caldwell Presbyterian Church and a year later the college moved into its own downtown building . The campus moved to its present site on the east side of town in 1910 when Henry and Carrie Blatchley donated 20 acres of land . Sterry Hall , a classroom and administration building , and Finney Hall , the first residence hall , were built that year . Voorhees Hall , the second of what would become a total of five residence halls , opened two years later . In 1893 , it was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho and placed in the hands of a self - perpetuating Board of Trustees . Dr. Boone served as president of the College for 45 years until his death in 1936 . In 1991 , the college changed its name to Albertson College of Idaho to honor alumnus and long - time donor Joe Albertson and his wife Kathryn . As alumni , the Albertsons were generous benefactors of the college and were founders of one of the country 's largest supermarket chains , Albertson 's Inc . The college offers 32 majors and 37 minors and 17 collaborative programs through its 16 departments .
