1 - 800 - Flowers is a major flower retailer and distribution company in the United States . It is a pioneer both in the use of a 24 x 7 toll - free telephone number and in the use of online media and the Internet for direct sales to consumers . The company was originally founded by Carl Westcott and later sold to Jim Poage and John Davis in 1982 . The company was acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann , an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976 , to facilitate the ordering of flowers and floral arrangements via the telephone . The company specializes in retail sales of flowers and gift items within the United States and internationally . The company was among the first retailers to partner with online pioneers CompuServe and AOL in 1992 and 1994 , respectively . In April 1995 , the company was one of the first retailers to establish its own Internet presence . In 1999 , the company went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol ( NASDAQ : FLWS ) . It was then that the company officially changed its trademarked name to 1 - 800 - FLOWERS.COM , to match its Web site URL . In subsequent years , the company has merged or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies . It has also established a business - to - business wing called BloomNet , a network of florists . While this network is substantially smaller than similar networks owned by FTD and Teleflora , the company claims that its member florists are screened more carefully than in those networks . The company is headquartered in Carle Place , New York , on Long Island .
