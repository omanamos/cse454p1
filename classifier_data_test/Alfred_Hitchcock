Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock KBE ( August 13 1899 – April 29 1980 ) was a highly influential film director and producer who pioneered many techniques in the suspense and thriller genres . He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades , from the silent film era , through the invention of talkies , to the colour era . Hitchcock was among the most consistently successful and publicly recognizable directors in the world during his lifetime , and remains one of the best known and most popular directors of all time , famous for his expert and largely unrivalled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies . Hitchcock was born and raised in Leytonstone , London , England . He began his directing career in the United Kingdom in 1922 , but from 1939 he worked primarily in the United States and applied for U.S. citizenship in 1956 . Hitchcock and his family lived in a mountaintop estate high above Scotts Valley , California , from 1940 to 1972 . He died of renal failure in 1980 . Hitchcock 's films draw heavily on both fear and fantasy , and are known for their droll humour . They often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding . Rebecca was the only one of his films to win the Academy Award for Best Picture , although four others were nominated . However , Hitchcock never won an Academy Award for Best Director . He was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in 1967 , but never personally received an Academy Award of Merit . Until the later part of his career , Hitchcock was far more popular with film audiences than with film critics , especially the elite British and American critics . In the late 1950s the French New Wave critics , especially Éric Rohmer , Claude Chabrol , and François Truffaut , were among the first to see and promote his films as artistic works . Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their auteur theory , which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film - making process . Hitchcock 's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers , producers , and actors . His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their movies without answering to the movie 's producer . Alfred Hitchcock was born on August 13 , 1899 , in Leytonstone , Essex ( now London ) , the second son and youngest of three children of William Hitchcock ( 1862 - 1914 ) , a greengrocer and poulterer , and his wife , Emma Jane Hitchcock ( née Whelan ; 1863 - 1942 ) . His family was mostly Roman Catholic . Hitchcock was sent to the Catholic school St. Ignatius College in London . He often described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered , which was undoubtedly compounded by his weight issues . Hitchcock claimed that on one occasion , early in his life , after he had acted childishly , his father sent him to the local police station carrying a note . When he presented the police officer on duty with the note , he was locked in a cell for a few moments , long enough to be petrified . This was a favorite anecdote of his , and the incident is often cited in connection with the theme of distrust of police which runs through many of
