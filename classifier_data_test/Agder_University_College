Campus Gimlemoen , located in Kristiansand . Agder University College ( HÃ¸gskolen i Agder ) has about 8000 students and 840 employees and is one of the largest institutions for higher education in Norway . Agder University College was instituted in 1994 after 6 colleges in Kristiansand , Grimstad and Arendal merged . As of today , the campus is split between three cities ; Arendal , Grimstad and Kristiansand , with the latter being the largest . Recently , the college board decided to merge the campuses in Arendal and Grimstad , and to locate the new campus in Grimstad , effective from fall 2006 . Currently the College offers degrees in a wide variety of subjects , such as various economics , engineering , nursing and other healthcare related , and music , as well as several other study programmes . All engineering programs are currently located in Grimstad , while most of the nursing and healthcare programmes are taught in Arendal , close to the local hospital . The reminder of the programmes and courses being taught in Kristiansand . Before 2000 , the various departments were situated in separate buildings in the centre of Kristiansand , much to the dismay of both students and employees . But as various defense cuts resulted in the closure of Gimlemoen , one of the military camps in the area , the college moved to this location , with the only exception being the music conservatory .
