Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium ( Stadio " Apostolos Nikolaidis " ) is the football ground Panathinaikos has played for most of the years of its existence , since its foundation back in 1908 . The stadium is named after deceased club president Apostolos Nikolaidis . It is in the Ampelokipi district of Athens , east of the Lycabettus Hill and on Alexandras Avenue , by which name it is most commonly known ( Leoforos Alexandras ) . The venue also houses a small basketball and volleyball court , a swimming pool , a boxing rink and offices , all contained under the stands . Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium holds a very important place in the history of Greek football . The first stand was built in 1928 , and for almost 50 years it hosted the majority of big matches in domestic and international competitions . It was the first to have floodlights installed ( 1938 ) and the first with a grass pitch ( 1958 ) . It was the home of the Greek National Team for many years . It is worth noting that the first indoor hall in Greece was constructed below the stands of the stadium , in 1959 . It has a capacity of 1,500 and is located below the east curve of Leoforos . Everyone knows it by its nickname : the " Indian 's tomb " . It was called that by journalists during its inaugural ceremony , as it reminded them of the namesake film by Fritz Lang that was featured in cinemas at that time . Panathinaikos left Leoforos in 1984 and moved to the Olympic Stadium . The club returned to their home ground in 2001 , following an upgrading that cost â‚¬7 million . Time , however , is relentless and Panathinaikos finally left their aging stadium in 2005 . Leoforos Stadium will be demolished and the area turned into a park . Due to the stadium 's old construction , dearth of space and dense urbanization of the area , the club has sought to move . Negotiations are currently under way between the Greek government , the Municipality of Athens , and the football , basketball , volleyball and amateur divisions of the club in order to facilitate the building of a new , comprehensive sports complex to house all of the 21 departments of Panathinaikos elsewhere . Finally , the industrial Votanikos district has been selected among others to house the complex and there are plans for the construction to begin in 2007 . Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni has stated that such a project will revitalise the area as well as benefit the club . In January 27 , 2007 Panathinaikos Amateur and Panathinaikos FC decided to reuse Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the 2007 / 2008 Greek Super League season , while the Athens Olympic Stadium will host the club 's European matches . Also , the club directors will install new lawn after two years , seats and upgrade the press conference room and all the rest rooms . The project will begin soon after 2006 - 2007 league end .
