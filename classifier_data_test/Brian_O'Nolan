Brian O'Nolan ( Irish : Brian Ó Núalláin ) ( October 5 , 1911 – April 1 , 1966 ) was a twentieth century Irish novelist and satirist , best known for his novels An Béal Bocht , At Swim - Two - Birds and The Third Policeman written under the nom de plume Flann O'Brien . He also wrote many satirical columns in the Irish Times under the name Myles na gCopaleen . Most of O'Nolan 's writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals , which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars . Not surprisingly , little of O'Nolan 's pseudonymous activity is or can ever be verified . A key feature of O'Nolan 's personal situation was his status as an Irish government civil servant , who , as a result of his father 's relatively early death , was obliged to support 10 siblings , including an older brother who was an unsuccessful writer . The Irish civil service has been , since the Irish Civil War fairly strictly apolitical , Civil Servants above the level of clerical officer are generally prohibited from publicly expressing political views both by Civil Service Regulations and the service 's internal culture . As a practical matter , this meant that commentating in Newspapers on current events was , during O'Nolan 's career , generally prohibited without departmental permission on a article - by - article , publication - by - publication basis . This fact alone contributed to O'Nolan 's use of pseudonyms , though he had started to create character - authors even in his pre - civil service writings . In reality , that O'Nolan was Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret , largely disregarded by his colleagues , who found his writing very entertaining ; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service , which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination - - it was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to 1970s . Nonetheless , had O'Nolan forced the issue , by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians , consequences would likely have flowed - - hence the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today . O'Nolan wrote prodigiously during his years as a student at University College Dublin , contributing to the student magazine Comhthrom Féinne ( Fair Game ) under various guises , in particular the pseudonym Brother Barnabas . Significantly , he composed a story during this same period entitled " Scenes in a Novel ( probably posthumous ) by Brother Barnabas " , which anticipates many of the ideas and themes later to be found in his novel , At Swim - Two - Birds . In it , the putative author of the story finds himself in riotous conflict with his characters , who are determined to follow their own paths regardless of the author 's design . For example , the villain of the story , one Carruthers McDaid , intended by the author as the lowest form of scoundrel , " meant to sink slowly to absolutely the last extremities of human degradation " , instead ekes out a modest living selling cats to elderly ladies and becomes a covert churchgoer without the author 's consent . Think it over. ' . In 1934 O'Nolan and his student friends founded a short - lived magazine called Blather . Blather is here . As we
