A Time for George Stavros is an early , unpublished , non - science fiction novel by author Philip K. Dick . It was written sometime around 1955 , a time when Dick was getting his science fiction published but still dreamed of being a mainstream writer . According to Lawrence Sutin 's book , Divine Invasions : A Life of Philip K. Dick , ( 1989 ) the plot survives only as an index card synopsis from the publisher dated 10 / 24 / 56 , after the manuscript had already been rejected one time . Long , rambling , glum novel about 65 yr old Greek immigrant who has a weakling son , a second son about whom he 's indifferent , a wife who does n't love him ( She 's being unfaithful to him ) . Nothing much happens . Guy , selling garage & retiring , tries to buy another garage in new development , has a couple of falls , dies at end . Point is murky but seems to be that world is disintegrating , Stavros supposed to be symbol of vigorous individuality now a lost commodity. " . There is no trick that the wicked can play on the good that will ultimately be successful ; the good are protected by God , or at least by their virtue. " . Much of the plot for this lost novel was apparently re - treaded and re - used in Dick 's later non - SF novel , Humpty Dumpty In Oakland ( written 1960 , published 1987 ) . As Dick was writing Humpty at roughly the same time he wrote the letter above , this might explain his uncharacteristically cheery assessment of the character .
