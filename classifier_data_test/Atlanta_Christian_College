Atlanta Christian College ( founded 1937 ) is located in East Point , Georgia . It exists to educate men and women for service in the church and society to the glory of God . The schoolâ€™s Christian theology has its roots in , but is not limited to , the Restoration Movement along with the Christian Church and the Church of Christ . Atlanta Christian College offers degrees in Humanities , Biblical Studies , Human Relations , Early Childhood Education , Business , Music , and English . The school is dedicated to cultivating students with a solid Christian worldview . The heritage of Atlanta Christian College ( ACC ) includes the stories of two short - lived institutions , Lamar College ( 1913 - 15 ) and Southeastern Christian College ( 1915 - 25 ) , both of which were supported by people of the Christian churches of Georgia and on both of which Judge T.O. Hathcock served as a trustee . This heritage also includes the earliest efforts to bring ACC into existence . Judge and Mrs. Hathcock provided land ( part of the farm inherited by Nora Head Hathcock ) , a building , and financial resources for the Christian School ( 1925 - 27 ) and , beginning in 1928 , for Atlanta Christian College . The Great Depression forced the college to close in 1930 , but the founders of ACC were determined this would not be the end of the story . Since 1937 , when the doors opened once again , ACC has operated continuously . The school stands in tribute to the vision and tenacity of her founders and of those who have shared their sense of mission and devotion .
