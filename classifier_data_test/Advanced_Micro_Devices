Advanced Micro Devices , Inc. ( abbreviated AMD ; NYSE : AMD ) is an American manufacturer of semiconductors based in Sunnyvale , California . The company was founded in 1969 by a group of former executives from Fairchild Semiconductor , including Jerry Sanders , III , Ed Turney , John Carey , Sven Simonsen , Jack Gifford and three members from Gifford 's team , Frank Botte , Jim Giles and Larry Stenger . AMD is the world 's second - largest supplier of x86 based processors and the world 's second largest supplier of graphics cards and GPUs , after taking control over ATI in 2006 . AMD also owns a 37 % share of Spansion , a supplier of non - volatile flash memory . 4.2 AMD Live ! . As of February 2007 , its market capitalization stands around US$8.50 billion . AMD is seventh among semiconductor manufacturers with revenues in 2006 of $7.471 billion . The current chairman and CEO is Dr. HÃ©ctor Ruiz and the current president and chief operating officer is Dirk Meyer . AMD started as a producer of logic chips in 1969 , then entered the RAM chip business in 1975 . That same year , it introduced a reverse - engineered clone of the Intel 8080 microprocessor . During this period , AMD also designed and produced a series of bit - slice processor elements ( Am2900 , Am29116 , Am293xx ) which were used in various minicomputer designs . During this time , AMD attempted to embrace the perceived shift towards RISC with their own AMD 29K processor , and they attempted to diversify into graphics and audio devices as well as EPROM memory . It had some success in the mid - 80s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 " World Chip " FSK modem , one of the first multistandard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300 / 300 full duplex . While the AMD 29K survived as an embedded processor and AMD spinoff Spansion continues to make industry leading flash memory , AMD was not as successful with its other endeavors . AMD decided to switch gears and concentrate solely on Intel - compatible microprocessors and flash memory . This put them in direct competition with Intel for x86 compatible processors and their flash memory secondary markets . AMD has a long history of litigation with former partner and x86 creator Intel . In 1986 Intel broke an agreement it had with AMD to allow them to produce Intel 's micro - chips for IBM ; AMD filed for arbitration in 1987 and the arbitrator decided in AMD 's favor in 1992 . Intel disputed this , and the case ended up in the Supreme Court of California . In 1994 , that court upheld the arbitrator 's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract . In 1990 , Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode . The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel 's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation . In 1997 , Intel filed suit against AMD and Cyrix Corp. for misuse of the term MMX . AMD and Intel settled , with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel , and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor . In 2005 , following an investigation , the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty on a number
