Henry Charles Bukowski ( August 16 , 1920 â€“ March 9 , 1994 ) was an influential Los Angeles poet and novelist . Bukowski 's writing was heavily influenced by the geography and atmosphere of his home city of Los Angeles . He is often mentioned as an influence by contemporary authors , and his style is frequently imitated . A prolific author , Bukowski wrote thousands of poems , hundreds of short - stories , and six novels , eventually having more than fifty books in print . Charles Bukowski was born in Andernach , Germany , in 1920 as Heinrich Karl Bukowski . His mother Katharina Fett , a native German , met his father , a Polish American serviceman , after the end of World War I. Coincidentally , Bukowski 's paternal grandfather had also been born in Germany . Bukowski was fond of claiming that he had been born out of wedlock , but Andernach records show that his parents were in fact married a month prior to his birth . After the collapse of the German economy following WWI , the family moved to Baltimore in 1923 . To sound more American , Bukowski 's parents began calling him " Henry " and altered the pronunciation of their last name from Buk - ov - ski to Buk - cow - ski . After saving money , the family moved to suburban Los Angeles , where Bukowski 's father 's family lived . During Bukowski 's childhood , his father was often unemployed , and according to Bukowski , verbally and physically abusive ( as detailed in his novel , Ham on Rye ) . During his youth Bukowski suffered from extreme acne and shyness . After graduating from Los Angeles High School , Bukowski attended Los Angeles City College for two years , taking courses in art , journalism and literature . In the documentary Born Into This he speaks of losing his virginity at age 24 to a " 300 pound whore " and breaking the bed in doing so . At 24 , Bukowski 's short - story " Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip " was published in Story Magazine . Two years later , another short - story , " 20 Tanks From Kasseldown , " was published in Portfolio III 's broadside - collection. Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade . During part of this period he went on living in Los Angeles , but also spent some time roaming around the United States , working odd jobs and staying in cheap rooming houses . In the early 1950s Bukowski took a job as a letter - carrier with the United States Postal Service in Los Angeles , but quit after less than three years . In 1955 he was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer that was nearly fatal . When he left the hospital , he began to write poetry . In 1957 , he married writer and poet Barbara Frye , but they divorced in 1959 . Frye insisted that their separation had nothing to do with literature , though she often doubted his skill as a poet . Following the divorce , Bukowski resumed drinking and continued to write poetry . By 1960 he had returned to the post office in Los Angeles , where he continued to work as a clerk for over a decade . In 1964 , a daughter , Marina Louise Bukowski , was born to Bukowski and his then live - in girlfriend
