Dix Stadium 's west grandstand seen from the parking lot . Dix Stadium is a stadium in Kent , Ohio . It is primarily used for American football , and is the home field of the Kent State University Golden Flashes . It lies at the far eastern end of the KSU campus along Summit Street , just east of State Route 261 and is the center piece of what has become an athletic complex . From 1997 - 2005 , the field hockey team also played its games at the stadium until a new field hockey stadium was constructed behind Dix Stadium . The KSU Softball , Women 's Soccer , Field Hockey , and Indoor Track teams all play their home matches in facilities around Dix Stadium . The stadium also hosts the occasional high school football game and served as the host of the 2001 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Championship . It opened on September 13 , 1969 with a win against in - state rival Dayton . It was named in honor of Robert C. Dix , a member of Kent 's Board of Trustees for more than three decades . The 29,287 - seat stadium consists of four separate grandstands on each side of the field . The west side is the largest , and the recently rebuilt east side ( student seating ) is the smallest . On either side of the east grandstands are spaces for party tents . Permanent lights were added in 1996 . Artificial turf was installed in 1997 and replaced in 2005 with the latest version of FieldTurf . The current scoreboard with a 15x17 - foot video display was added in 1998 . Prior to the 2002 season , the east side stands , remnants of the original Memorial Stadium , were demolished . The current east side bleachers were constructed after the 2002 season and were completed in time for the 2003 season opener . The new configuration slightly altered the stadium 's seating capacity reducing it from 30,520 to the current 29,287 . In a 5 December 2006 interview with the local Record - Courier newspaper , KSU athletic director Laing Kennedy discussed off - season plans for Dix Stadium which involve removing the current north and south end zone seating and installing smaller bleachers only in the north end zone . In the south end zone , a new archway with a color replay scoreboard ( similar to the setup at Miami University 's Yager Stadium ) is being planned as well as a message board facing Summit Street . Additional plans include a permanent home to the new " Tailgate Alley " outside the stadium as well as landscaping , new fencing , and entryways . Work is scheduled to begin during the summer of 2007 and the university is hopeful to have improvements finished by the start of the 2007 football season . The current end zone sections of Dix Stadium were the sideline seats at KSU 's old Memorial Stadium , which stood on what is now the visitor parking lot in front of the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center and Student Center . When Dix Stadium was built in the late 1960 's , the old stadium was dismantled and then reassembled at the new site in its current configuration . Although many crowds have come close , Dix Stadium has never officially been sold out for a Kent State game . The largest KSU football crowd ever at Dix Stadium was 27,363 on November 10 , 1973 for a
