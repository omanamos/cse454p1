Azerbaijan Technical University ( AzTU ; Azerbaijani : Az…ôrbaycan Texniki Universiteti ) is a public university , specialized in engineering , located in Baku , Azerbaijan . The University has 9 schools and 54 departments , 884 faculty members and approximately 6500 students . The University traces its history to the much older Baku Polytechnical Institute . On November 14 , 1920 , after the invasion of the Red Army and the establishment of the fledgling Azerbaijan SSR , the new government decreed that the previous technical school , Baku Polytechnicum , would close and be replaced by Baku Polytechnical Institute , a more traditional polytechnic institute . The new school focused on training engineers in a a broad range of industries : agriculture , civil engineering , electromechanical , economics and oil . The new school went through many name changes over the years as its emphasis changed to meet the needs of Azerbaijan . In 1923 the school changed its name to Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute . In March 1929 , the Azerbaijan Communist Party decreed that the school be split into three independent schools covering agriculture , economics and oil . However , the expanding needs engineers in other areas outside oil resulted in expansion in the school 's curriculum and the school changed names again in 1934 , this time to the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute ( Az . I.I. ) as it was merged with civil engineering . World War II taxed the Soviet Union and schools like Az. I.I. struggled to stay open . At the end of the War , there was great demand for oil engineers in the Soviet Union and the school trained them in great numbers . In 1950 , the government founded a separate Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute ( Az . P.I. ) and moved non - petrochemical curricula to the new school so that Az. I.I. could focus on the oil industry ( Az . I.I. went on to eventually become the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy ) . In 1970 , a branch of AzPI was founded in Ganja . In 1993 , AzPI changed status and became Azerbaijan Technical University . This European university , college or other education institution article is a stub .
