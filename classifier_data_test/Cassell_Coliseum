Cassell Coliseum is a 10,052 - seat multi - purpose arena in Blacksburg , Virginia , United States . The arena opened in 1961 . It is home to the Virginia Tech Hokies basketball teams ( men 's and women 's ) . Built as a replacement for the much smaller War Memorial Gymnasium , the Coliseum 's construction began in 1961 . It was completed in December 1964 at a cost of $2.7 million . It was designed by Carneal and Johnston , ( now Ballou Justice Upton Architects , Richmond , Va ) and built by T.C. Brittain and Company of Decatur , Georgia . Originally just referred to as " the Coliseum , " it was dedicated on September 17 , 1977 to the late Stuart K. Cassell , former school business manager , first Vice President of Administration , and major supporter of the building of the arena . The first game , however , was on January 3 , 1962 . The Hokies played Alabama . The Hokies won 91 - 67 . Unfortunately , the crowd sat on the concrete floor to watch the game because the seats had not arrived . In the early years of the Coliseum , the Hokies frequently saw capacity crowds pack the venue . In recent years , however , this has not been the case . Student and alumni interest in basketball decreased in the 1990s due to the Hokies ' lack of a stable basketball conference home and due to the success of the football team . Fan support has begun to gain momentum under the new coaching staff and the school 's recent move to the ACC , which includes archrival Virginia . Arguably the best game that took place at Cassell Coliseum occurred on February 17 , 2005 , during Virginia Tech 's first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference . In their first meeting at Cameron Indoor Stadium on January 30 , the Duke Blue Devils beat the Hokies by 35 points . Coming into Blacksburg , the Blue Devils were ranked third nationally . By the end of the night , the Blue Devils were handed a 67 - 65 loss to the Hokies in front of 9,847 fans . It was the first time that Virginia Tech had beaten Duke since 1966 . However , there is one recent game that might challenge for this prominency . On January 13 , 2007 , Virginia Tech defeated the number one ranked North Carolina Tar Heels by a score of 94 - 88 . At one point in the game , the hokies led by 29 points . They were able to hold off a strong surge by the Tar Heels to seal the victory . The largest crowd ever at Cassell was 11,500 for Purdue on December 3 , 1966 . On April 17 , 2007 , a memorial convocation was held there in response to the shootings of 32 students and faculty on the Virginia Tech campus the previous day .
