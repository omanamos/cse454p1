Colt Stadium junkyard , photo taken February 18 , 1973 . Colt Stadium was a Major League baseball stadium that formerly stood in Houston , Texas . It was the home of the Houston Colt .45s . It was their temporary home from 1962 - 1964 while the Astrodome was being built , just to the south of it . The stadium consisted of an uncovered grandstand stretching from foul pole to foul pole and small bleacher stands in right and left field . One baseball annual published just before the 1962 season referred to it as " a barn - like thing " . It is best remembered for the horribly hot and humid weather ( and attendant mosquito population ) that had necessitated building the first domed stadium . The stadium was abandoned after the Astrodome was completed . It sat abandoned for ten years , accumulating random odds and ends from near - by Astroworld and weathering in the blistering Texas sun . It was eventually broken down and moved to Gomez Palacio to serve as the home of a Mexican League baseball team . Its site was paved over , adding some area to the Astrodome parking lot .
