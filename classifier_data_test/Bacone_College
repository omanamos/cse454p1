Its current president is Rev. Dr. Robert J. Duncan , Jr. , a United Methodist minister from Drew University . Bacone College sports compete as the Warriors in the Red River Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) . The college traces its origins to a request to the American Baptist Home Mission Society by Professor Almon C. Bacone , a missionary teacher , to start a school in the Cherokee Baptist Mission at Tahlequah , Indian Territory . The only faculty member , Professor Bacone , enrolled three students and by the end of the first semester , the student body had quadrupled ; by the end of the first year , student population was fifty - six and the faculty numbered three . Seeing the need to expand , an appeal was made to the Muscogee ( Creek ) Nation 's Tribal Council for 160 acres of land in nearby Muskogee , Oklahoma , known then as the " Indian Capital of the World. " . The land was granted , and in 1885 Indian University was moved to its present site . In 1910 , it was renamed Bacone Indian University after its founder and first president and was later changed to Bacone College by its Board of Trustees . Patrick J. Hurley attended Bacone College . One of the first buildings to be erected was Rockefeller Hall , a three - story building made possible by a $10,000 contribution from John D. Rockefeller . It was razed in 1938 and a Memorial Chapel was built in its place , which was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in the 1990s . The campus contains many other reminders of Bacone 's history , tradition , and goals . One of these is a small cemetery , the final resting place of Bacone Presidents Almon C. Bacone ( 1880 - 1896 ) and Benjamin D. Weeks ( 1918 - 1941 ) , as well as others associated with the school . A " stone bible " sculpture marks the spot on which President Bacone and two Baptist missionaries who were also trustees of Indian University , Joseph Samuel Murrow and Daniel Rogers , knelt in prayer to dedicate the college . The names of all its presidents , are inscribed on its surface .
