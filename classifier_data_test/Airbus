Airbus S.A.S. is the aircraft manufacturing subsidiary of EADS N.V. , a pan - European aerospace concern . Based at Toulouse , France with significant operations in other European states , Airbus produces around half of the world 's jet airliners , with most of the rest built by rival Boeing Commercial Airplanes , though the precise share varies on an annual basis . Airbus was incorporated in 2001 under French law as a simplified joint stock company or S.A.S. ( Société par Actions Simplifiée ) . Airbus was formerly known as Airbus Industrie . Airbus was jointly held by EADS ( 80 % ) and BAE Systems ( 20 % ) , Europe 's two largest defence contractors . BAE Systems announced its intention to sell its 20 % share of Airbus in April 2006 and exercised its put option in June 2006 to force EADS to buy the stake . The put option appointed investment bank Rothschild to establish an independent valuation . Rothschild 's valuation , reported in 2006 , was £1.9 billion ( €2.75 billion ) , well below the expectations of BAE and EADS . On 6 September 2006 the BAE board announced it would recommend to shareholders to sell its share for €2.75bn ( £1.87bn or $3.53bn ) . Airbus employs around 57,000 people at sixteen sites in four European countries : Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Spain . Final assembly production occurs at Toulouse ( France ) and Hamburg ( Germany ) . Airbus also has three subsidiaries in the USA , Japan and China . A340 - 600 at Farnborough Air Show , 2006 . Airbus Industrie began as a consortium of European aviation firms to compete with American companies such as Boeing , McDonnell Douglas , and Lockheed . In the 1960s European aircraft manufacturers competed with each other as much as the American giants . In the mid - 1960s tentative negotiations commenced regarding a European collaborative approach . In September 1967 the German , French and British governments signed a Memorandum of understanding . In the months following this agreement both the French and British governments expressed doubts about the aircraft . Another problem was the requirement for a new engine ( to be developed by Rolls - Royce , the RB207 ) . In December 1968 the French and British partner companies , Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley proposed a revised configuration , the 250 seat Airbus A250 . Renamed the A300B the aircraft would not require new engines , reducing development costs . In 1969 the British government shocked its partners by withdrawing from the project . Given the participation by Hawker Siddeley up to that point , France and Germany were reluctant to take over their wing design . Thus the British company was allowed to continue as a major subcontractor . In 1978 Britain rejoined the consortium when British Aerospace ( the merged Hawker Siddeley and BAC ) purchased again a 20 % share of the company . Airbus A300 , the first aircraft model launched by Airbus . Airbus Industrie was formally set up in 1970 following an agreement between Sud - Aviation ( France ) and Deutsche Airbus—itself a German aerospace consortium consisting of Bölkow , Dornier , Flugzeug - Union Süd , HFB , Messerschmitt , TG Siebelwerke , and VFW . The grouping was joined by CASA of Spain in 1971 . Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped , ready to fly items . The name " Airbus " was taken from a non
