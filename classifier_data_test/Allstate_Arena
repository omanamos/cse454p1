Allstate Arena is a sports arena in Rosemont , Illinois , which is home to the Chicago Wolves hockey club , DePaul University men 's basketball , and the Chicago Rush Arena football team . It is located near the intersection of Mannheim Road and Interstate 90 , adjacent to O'Hare International Airport . The facility , originally named the Rosemont Horizon , was intended to be the home of the WHA Chicago Cougars , but the franchise folded in 1975 . The Village of Rosemont issued $19 million in bonds to finance the cost of the arena with exclusive contracts with Araserv , the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus , and MFG International . On August 13 , 1979 , the uncompleted roof of the Rosemont Horizon collapsed , killing five construction workers and injuring 16 others . The roof , a wooden structure to insulate against noise from nearby O'Hare International Airport , was not properly constructed , and as the final beams were being put into place , a strong breeze blew the entire structure down . Over 53 percent of the required connection bolts were missing from the building 's roof . 944 girder bolts required for the connections had already been installed , though only 444 were in place ; of these , 338 had no nuts . However , the primary cause of the collapse was the fact that the roof construction was behind schedule , causing the 300 ' + roof girders to have no lateral stability . Estimated damages caused by the collapse was $3 million . The roof was later rebuilt to specifications by a different contractor , and the arena was completed . In 1999 , Allstate Insurance Company paid $20 million to renovate it and gain its naming rights . The arena is a Midwestern cornerstone for the WWE . It has hosted WrestleMania 2 , WrestleMania 13 , and WrestleMania 22 . It has also hosted Survivor Series 1989 , Judgment Day 1998 , Backlash 2001 , and the very first WWF pay - per - view event , The Wrestling Classic . It will host No Mercy 2007 .
