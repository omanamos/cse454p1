Eiraliz Bermudez , better known as Aira Bermudez ( born September 6 , 1983 in Pampanga , Philippines ) , is a Filipina dancer and actress . She is a member of the past dance group of Eat Bulaga ! , the SexBomb Girls . She can currently be seen in Daisy Siete and co - hosted a limited - run dance program on QTV - 11 ' Let 's Get Aww ! ' . Member of SexBomb Girls since 2000 . The SexBomb Girls ( both dancers and singers ) rebelled and stayed away from working in the Eat Bulaga show when one of its producers hired a member ( Sugar ) and promoted her heavily . Manager Joy Cancio claimed she decided to take the famous girly band off the show in protest at this . As a result , media sources reported that the SexBomb Girls are being hired by rival network ABS - CBN to star in their recently - revived Wowowee noontime show , but Cancio denied the report and stressed that the band still has a long - term contract with GMA Network , especially with regards to the hit afternoon drama show Daisy Siete . The producer of Eat Bulaga accepted a texted apology from Cancio , but also said the time was right to move on . While it may seem unlikely that Sexbomb Girls will be returning to Eat Bulaga - being replaced by the young and fresh EB Babes , a group of dancers who survived intense auditions and hired by TAPE - the girls had a successful guest appearance December 2006 as part of the shows wish - fulfillment segment , where a young girl wished she could dance with Sexbomb , Jopay Paguia . In this show , Sugar Mercado joined the girl 's performance which means all 's well with everybody . This triumphant guest appearance of the Sexbomb Girls to Eat Bulaga have been since followed , most notably of which is the " showdown " between the SexBomb Girls and the EB Babes ( February 3 , 2007 ) . This could only mean that they might be back as featured performers on the Saturday Edition of Eat Bulaga . On December 16 , 2006 , the SexBomb Girls appeared at Eat Bulaga for the first time after nine months during the " Give Love on Christmas Day " portion with a song and dance number . Former SexBomb Girl Sugar Mercado joined the girls in the said number and some Eat Bulaga hosts were happy to see them again . And on March 12 , the SexBomb Girls returned as regulars once again but they'll appear only twice a week ( every Mondays and Wednesdays ) . Weight : 105 lbs .
