Bruno Schulz ( July 12 , 1892 – November 19 , 1942 ) was a Polish novelist and painter , widely considered to be one of the greatest Polish prose stylists of the 20th century . Schulz was born in Drohobycz , at the time when it was part of the Austro - Hungarian Empire , in the province of Galicia ( now Drohobych is in Ukraine ) to assimiliated Jewish parents . At a very early age , he developed an interest in painting , and eventually studied architecture at Lwów University , and fine arts in Vienna . He taught drawing in his home town , where his father , Jacob Schulz , was a paper merchant . The author nurtured his extraordinary imagination in a swarm of identities and nationalities : a Polish Jew who spoke Yiddish , Polish and German . Yet there was nothing cosmopolitan about him ; his genius fed in solitude on specific local and ethnic sources . He scarcely ever left his home town , and his adult life was that of a hermit , uneventful and enclosed . Schulz became a writer by chance , after several letters that he wrote to a friend , in which he gave highly original accounts of his solitary life and the details of the lives of his fellow - citizens , were brought to the attention of the novelist Zofia Nałkowska . She encouraged Schulz to have them published as short fiction , and The Cinnamon Shops ( Sklepy Cynamonowe ) was published in 1934 ; in English - speaking countries , it is most often referred to by its English title , The Street of Crocodiles . This novel - memoir was followed three years later by Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass ( Sanatorium Pod Klepsydrą ) . The original publications were fully illustrated by Schulz himself ; however , in later editions of his works these illustrations are often left out or are poorly reproduced . While Schulz spoke German and Yiddish , he wrote his stories in Polish . He also helped his fiancée translating Franz Kafka 's The Trial into Polish , in 1936 . In 1938 , he was awarded the Polish Academy of Literature 's prestigious Golden Laurel award . The outbreak of World War II in 1939 caught Schulz living in Drohobycz , which was occupied by the Soviet Union . There are reports that he worked on a novel called The Messiah , but no trace of this manuscript survived his death . Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union , as a Jew he was forced to live in the ghetto of Drohobycz , but some accounts state he was temporarily protected by Felix Landau , a Gestapo officer who admired his drawings . During the last weeks of his life , Schulz painted a mural in Landau 's home in Drohobycz , in the style with which he is identified . Shortly after completing the work , he was shot dead by a German officer , a rival of his protector , and his mural was hidden . In 2001 , representatives of Yad Vashem in Israel were allowed to come to Drohobycz to examine his final mural . Controversy ensued when over the course of the next three days , they removed five sections of the mural and transported them to Jerusalem . While Yad Vashem claims that the murals were legally purchased , Ukraine has officially stated that they were removed without authority or export licenses . As of
