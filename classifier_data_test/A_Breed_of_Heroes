A Breed of Heroes is a 1981 novel by Alan Judd . It narrates in third person the experiences of a young British Army officer as he is deployed on his first tour of duty , a four month operation in Armagh and Belfast at the height of The Troubles . Set in the 1970s , ‘’A Breed of Heroes’’ follows the deployment of young British Army officer Charles Thoroughgood on a four - month emergency tour of Northern Ireland . Charles is new to the army and the difficulty he has with adjusting to army life adds to the complications faced in Northern Ireland . Being an Oxford graduate at a time when over 90 % of army officers were school leavers makes him a conspicuous target for his deranged Commanding Officer’s attention , as well as three to four years older than his fellow Second Lieutenants . The first month of the tour is spent in the countryside of Armagh , where Charles’ battalion make their presence felt by ending all British Army contact with the locals and pursuing a deliberately more aggressive stance than the previous garrison unit . The month is mainly boring , with most days spent carrying out menial tasks in barracks or conducting patrols . However , towards the end of the period an anti - vehicle mine meant for Charles’ regular Land Rover patrol to an electricity sub - station destroys an electricity board van minutes before Charles arrives . Seeing his first explosion , as well as finding the scattered body parts of a man who should have been him and his soldiers , brings the realities of his situation home to him and increases his thoughts that he should never have joined the army : something which he must tackle throughout the book . In moving to Belfast for the remaining three months of the tour , things take a turn for the worst – something Charles thought couldn’t happen after the endless boredom and sporadic fear of Armagh . Billeted in a working factory which produces bottles 24 hours a day , his company’s quarters are ridiculed by the entire Belfast garrison as the worst in the city . The floor given over to officers for accommodation , dining and radio watch - keeping consists of ‘rooms’ created only by cardboard separations . As well as the deprivations of the location , Charles finds the customs of army life difficult to understand and get used to , especially as they seem to have no logic behind them . The officers and men of his battalion learn to deal with the pressures and squalor of urban guerrilla warfare by drinking , making mischief and engaging in sexual orgies . Charles , always aloof from his brother officers and institutionally separated from his men , finds it hard not to constantly question his own competency and worth , both as an officer and a human being . Having been involved in two riots , he is moved to Battalion Headquarters after the Press Relations Officer ( PRO ) has a negligent discharge and shoots himself in the foot . Charles shares his room with the Adjutant , and sets about ensuring that the battalion is seen in a good light by the press . This task is complicated somewhat by his Commanding Officer’s hatred of the press and idiosyncratic way of doing things , but Charles finds living in the police station which houses HQ much more bearable than the grim surrounds of the factory . More escapades follow , with
