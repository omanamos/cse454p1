The Boleyn Ground is the official name of Upton Park , the football stadium of West Ham United . West Ham United moved to the location in 1904 and rented ground from the " London " District of Upton Park ( the ground was actually in the Essex Council District of East Ham which did not become part of London until 1965 ) who were using Green Street House as a school . Green Street House was known locally as Boleyn Castle because of its imposing nature and an association with Anne Boleyn ( she had either stayed at , or as some believe , owned the house ) . Hence renting the grounds of " Boleyn Castle " the name Boleyn Ground came into being . Today the ground is far more commonly known as Upton Park , after the area of London in which it is located . In August 1944 , a V - 1 flying bomb landed on the south - west corner of the pitch . This forced the team to play their games away from home while repairs were carried out , but it did not seem to affect performances as they managed nine consecutive victories . Upon their return to the ground in December , they lost 1 - 0 to Tottenham Hotspur . The stadiums record attendance is 42322 , recorded against Tottenham Hotspur in a Division One ( Old ) match on 17th October 1970 , when the stadium was still all - standing . The record attendance at Upton Park since it has become an all - seater is 35050 , recorded against Manchester City on 21st September 2002 in a Premier League match . Champions Statue on Barking Road . The stadium has a total capacity of 35,647 all seated . 1993 : South Bank replaced by a new 9,000 seat , two tier stand named after Bobby Moore . The stand also incorporates executive boxes as well as a digital clock . 1995 : North Bank replaced by a new 6,000 seat , two tier stand named the ' Centenary Stand ' . The East Stand Lower is also made all seater . 2001 : West Stand replaced by a new 15,000 seat , two tier stand named the ' Dr . The stand also incorporates executive boxes on two levels as well as the West Ham United Hotel and Museum . Plans have been submitted to increase the capacity to approximately 42,000 through the building of a new East Stand . This will result in a fully enclosed stadium by joining the new stand to the Centenary Stand and the Bobby Moore Stand . Relegation to the Football League Championship in 2003 resulted in the development being delayed . However promotion to the FA Premier League via the Play - Offs in May 2005 resulted in the immediate re - submission of plans to Newham Council . The timing of the development is now dependent upon the club establishing itself again as a regular member of the Premier League . Throughout 2006 , talk was rife of West Ham moving to the Olympic Stadium of the 2012 Olympics , with speculation increasing after new club owner Eggert Magnusson confirmed he was interested in a move there . However , talks broke down between the club and the Olympic Comitee after it was announced that the Stadium would be reduced to 25,000 all seater after the Olympic Games , which is 10,000 less than what Upton Park currently holds , and that the stadium would be keeping its
