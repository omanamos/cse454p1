A Clash of Kings is the second of seven planned novels in A Song of Ice and Fire , an epic fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin . It was first published on 16 November 1998 in the United Kingdom , although the first United States edition did not follow until March 1999 . Like its predecessor , A Game of Thrones , it both won the 1999 Locus Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2000 Nebula Award for best novel . In May 2005 Meisha Merlin released a much - delayed limited edition of the novel , fully illustrated by John Howe . A Clash of Kings is also the name of the first expansion to the board game " A Game of Thrones " . A Clash of Kings is set in a fictitious world reminiscent of Medieval Europe ( primarily on a continent called Westeros ) , except for the fact that in this world , the seasons last for years and , sometimes , decades . A Clash of Kings picks up where A Game of Thrones ended . The Seven Kingdoms are plagued by civil war , while the Night 's Watch mounts a reconnaissance force north of the Wall to investigate the mysterious people , known as wildings , who live there and , in the distant east , Daenerys Targaryen continues her quest to return to and conquer the Seven Kingdoms . The civil war among the noble families of Stark , Lannister , and Baratheon becomes more complex when the Greyjoys enter the fight . Robb Stark 's attempts to secure an alliance with the Greyjoys are rebuffed and , instead , the Greyjoys launch a massive assault along the west coast of the North . At Winterfell , the Stark stronghold , Robb 's young brother Bran is in command ; he finds two new friends when Jojen and Meera Reed arrive from Greywater Watch . They take an interest in his strange dreams . Stannis Baratheon declares himself King of Westeros , having been encouraged by Melisandre , a red priestess . Enraged that his younger brother Renly has also claimed the throne , Stannis chooses to besiege Renly 's castle , Storm 's End to force Renly to march east and defend it . Catelyn Stark joins a parley between Renly and Stannis to discuss a possible Stark - Baratheon alliance against their mutual foe , the Lannisters . The parley ends in acrimony and Renly resolves to use his immeasurably vaster army to destroy Stannis in battle the next day ; however , a mysterious shadow kills him in his tent before the battle begins . Catelyn flees along with the only other witness to this murder , the warrior - maid Brienne of Tarth . Most of Renly 's supporters shift their loyalty to Stannis , but the Tyrells do not , and Storm 's End itself only falls when Melisandre magically creates another shadow to kill the castle 's defiant castellan . In King 's Landing Tyrion Lannister arrives to act as Hand of the King , closest adviser to the monarch . Whilst intriguing against his sister Cersei , widow of the late king and mother of King Joffrey , Tyrion improves the defenses of the city . Learning of Renly 's death , Tyrion sends the cunning schemer Littlefinger to negotiate with the Tyrells . Lord Mace Tyrell agrees to wed his daughter Margaery to Joffrey . Tyrion also arranges the marriage of Joffrey 's sister Princess Myrcella
