AMX LLC , commonly known as AMX , is a manufacturer of audio / visual control devices . AMX designs and manufactures hardware and software capable of remote control of a wide variety of equipment . Typical uses include room automation in boardrooms , auditoriums , museums or home theaters , where users use fixed and wireless touchscreens and remotes to control devices such as video projectors and displays , PCs , DVD and VCR players and recorders , cameras , teleconferencing systems , audio / video switchers and processing equipment , motorized projection screens , drapes , lighting , HVAC systems , and a wide variety of other types of equipment . Other common uses include entertainment systems , industrial command and control centers , security systems , hotels and restaurants . There are many other applications . AMX systems are configured from modular hardware , allowing systems to be customized to meet current needs , while providing a foundation for unlimited scalability to adapt to future requirements . Custom programming allows many functions to be reconfigured with a single button push , providing greatly improved ease of use with complex systems . For example , pressing a button labelled Video could cause the room lights to dim , the drapes to close , the projection screen to roll down , the projector and other components to turn on , switch to their appropriate inputs , and a DVD to start playing at a preset volume level . Remotes and touchscreens can be laid out with only the functions the typical user needs , while technical menus are password protected to prevent unauthorized tampering . The older AMX Axcent systems consist of local devices running directly on a proprietary Axlink Bus . The newer more powerful NetLinx systems are able to be controlled remotely over IP from anywhere in the world . Numerous software programs are available for programming and configuring the hardware , laying out touchscreens and remotes . AMX also offers a variety of ' Integration Solutions ' , which provide advanced feature packages and services that can be added to touchscreens . There are also specialized software packages for specific applications such as conference , meeting and classrooms , which combines room scheduling , the ability to reserve equipment , and remote monitoring of equipment status , such as automated email and pager announcements if a projector lamp fails . AMX distributes software for complete customization of display and function of their systems . Their flagship software suite , NetLinx Studio , integrates the NetLinx and Axcess compilers into a full - featured source code editor with organization , debugging , and research tools . Other applications , such as Touch Panel Design 4 , allow design of extremely complex and intricate touch panel interfaces . Finally , several utilitarian applications , such as DIP Switch and NetLinx Diagnostics , simplify and expedite tedious or difficult tasks . Programming an AMX control system , which is commonly a solo project undertaken by in - house or freelance programmers , involves a rare combination of skills in computer science , programming , user interface design , control systems programming , event - driven programming , audio visual systems technology , customer management , scope management and project management . On November 1 , 2006 , AMX announced it had acquired Endeleo , a UK - based manufacturer of analog audio visual distribution technologies . Just over a month later on December 4 , 2006 , AMX announced the acquisition of another signal switching and routing company ,
