For the Australian organization , see Australian Inter - service Incident Management System . All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) ( created 1956 ) is a medical college in India . It is located in New Delhi . It has been consistently ranked the top medical college in India by India Today . It is considered as the best public hospital in the country . It is also globally recognised for providing low - cost medical care to a large number of patients . Every year AIIMS accepts 45 students , of which 33 belong to General Category and 11 belong to the reserved category ( SC / ST ) and 1 orthopedic physically handicapped , based on the results of an all - India entrance examination for its MBBS program . The number of students who take the entrance exam every year varies from 70,000 to 80,000 . Five international students ( nominated by Government of India ) complete the class size of 50 . AIIMS also specializes in paramedical and basic science training . There are about 42 specialty post - graduate courses conducted at AIIMS . The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination held every six months . These courses are highly coveted by the medical graduates across the country because of the institution 's excellent medical services , exposure to unusual & referred cases and excellent opportunities for research . AIIMS has been ranked repeatedly at the top in its field in annual surveys ( starting in 1997 ) published by India Today . At present ( 2006 - 07 ) , in the medical colleges and institution survey ( MCIS ) conducted by WHO , AIIMS ranked first in Asia . The hospital also earned the First Priority Hospitals ( FPH ) standard by Time Magazine . As per Forbes ( Germany ) , most European nations recommend AIIMS for medical tourism in Asia . The hospital has been able to maintain high standards of quality while seeing large numbers of patients ( 3.5 million in 2006 ) at very low cost to patients , many of whom live in extreme poverty . AIIMS was originally built as a Superspeciality tertiary care centre with primary emphasis on research and specialized training facilities . There are at least 45 superspecialities at AIIMS . Having clinical superspecialities in the same campus as its major research facilities makes AIIMS optimally suited for nurturing best quality translational research in India . However growing concern has been expressed that the quality of scholars inducted in AIIMS at postdoc and faculty levels has increasingly been deteriorating , mainly because of nepotism . Moreover , most medical students who train at AIIMS do n't stay at AIIMS ( primarily because of lack of professional opportunities and more lucrative options abroad ) . As per the AIIMS Citizen 's Charter , doctors & staff at AIIMS strive to provide comprehensive , high quality tertiary care services including specialty and super - specialty services to all without consideration of caste , creed , religion , sex , economic status or disability . However , there may be some deficiencies due to extreme patient load and finite resources . Acquiring newer equipment for investigation , research and patient care is expedited as it is not constrained by funds . Despite the high volume of patients treated , mortality rates at AIIMS are comparable to some of the best medical institutions of the world . There is a separate cardiothoracic and neurosciences centre ( CNC ) offering superspecialty level patient care ,
