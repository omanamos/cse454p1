Alicia Lynelle Goranson ( born June 22 , 1974 , in Evanston , Illinois ) , better known as Lecy Goranson , is an American actress . At age 14 , Alicia Lynelle Goranson was cast in the role of Becky Conner in the 1988 television sitcom Roseanne . Goranson exited the series in 1993 ( the start of the show 's fifth season ) to pursue an education at Vassar College . Sara Gilbert , too , pursued her education ; however , her schedule permitted her to appear part - time as Darlene . Under the new arrangement , the show 's producers and writers had to take care to write scenes for Becky sparingly . Goranson 's exit resulted in Becky 's eloping with her husband , Mark , who was played by Glenn Quinn . Becky would be seen via the phone briefly on some occasions as she lived out of state . In the next season , although not at the beginning , the producers decided to bring the character back . Goranson was still unavailable , so in a same character , different actor situation , Sarah Chalke ( better known now for her role as Elliot Reid on Scrubs ) was brought into the role . When the show reached its eighth season , Goranson managed to schedule things so that she could work as Becky , replacing Chalke . Goranson appeared continuously at the beginning but mid - season it became a problem . On two occasions , Goranson had to pull out of episodes Becky was intended to appear in , so Chalke took over the role once again . These episodes include the family visit to Walt Disney World and Darlene and David 's wedding , episodes in which Becky was needed . Goranson appeared again towards the end of the season ; however , she decided not to continue following the end of the eighth season . For the ninth and final year , Goranson did not return to the show as Becky Conner , leaving the role to Sarah Chalke for the final season . She was born in Evanston , Illinois , to David and Linda Goranson . She is Protestant . Since Roseanne , she had several small roles in films and has guest starred in both Law & Order : Special Victims Unit and Sex and the City . In her film roles as an adult , she is normally credited as Alicia rather than Lecy .
