Aggie Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Las Cruces , New Mexico . It is primarily used for American football , and is the home field of the New Mexico State University Aggie . It opened in 1978 and holds 30,343 people . Prior to the building of the stadium , the Aggies had played on the same site since 1933 . Located just to the northeast of Hadley Hall ( home to the president 's office ) , and originally known as Quesenberry Field , the original Memorial Stadium was built over it in 1950 . It was dedicated as a memorial to New Mexico A&M students who had died in World War II , World War I , and the Spanish - American War , among whom was Henry C. Gilbert Jr. , whose parents were instrumental in the 10 - year long fundraising drive . Memorial Stadium , which served for twenty - eight seasons , was replaced , both due to its small size ( at maximum , the seating capacity was only 12,155 ) and the want of an expanded athletics plant with more infrastructure and parking . The " new " Aggie Memorial Stadium , this time dedicated to alumni who had served in the Korean War and Vietnam War , was built for $4 million over a period of eighteen months . It was funded by the New Mexico state legislature as part of a capital project on the campus . The first home game saw the Aggies beat rival UTEP 35 - 32 on September 16 , 1978 . Twenty years and ten days later , the Aggies and Miners played to the largest crowd in stadium history , with 32,993 in attendance to see the Aggies win again , 33 - 24 . The stadium , designed by alumnus Craig Protz of Bohering - Protz Associates , was built in a natural bowl just to the south of the Pan American Center , the home of Aggie basketball . The first level of seating wraps around the field , except for two 100 - foot wide sections above either endzone . The southern is used as a berm , with the Fulton Athletic Center , a $6 million fieldhouse and athletic training and education center which opened in 2004 , behind it . The northern end leads to the ticket office and main entrace to the stadium . The seating extends to a rounded second level on either side of the field , which extends the length of the seating bowl . The stadium also is known for being well - lit for night games , with sodium vapor lighting on four poles on the stadium 's corners rising 175 feet above the playing field . In addition to football , the stadium also serves for commencement ceremonies and other large outdoor gatherings on campus .
