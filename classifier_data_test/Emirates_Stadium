The Emirates Stadium is a football stadium located on Ashburton Grove in Holloway , north London , and the home of Arsenal Football Club since it opened in July 2006 . The stadium has an all - seated capacity of 60,432 , making it the second largest stadium in the Premiership after Old Trafford , and the third - largest stadium of any kind in London , after Wembley and Twickenham . During the planning and construction stages , it was known as Ashburton Grove before a naming rights deal with the airline Emirates was struck in October 2004 . The stadium project cost £390 million , but not all was for the actual construction of the stadium itself . The stadium is a four - tiered bowl with roofing over the stands but not over the pitch . The design team was made up of architects HOK Sport , construction consultants AYH , and engineering firm Buro Happold . The stadium was constructed by Sir Robert McAlpine on the site of the former Ashburton Grove industrial estate , several hundred metres from Arsenal 's former stadium Highbury . The upper ( 26,646 ) and lower ( 24,425 ) tiers of the stadium are standard seating . For the 2006 - 07 season , ticket prices for an adult range between £32 and £66 for most matches , but as cheap as £13 for juniors . Season ticket prices for 2006 - 07 ranged between £885 and £1,825 . The main middle tier , known as the " Club Level " , is premium priced and also includes the director 's box . There are 7,139 seats at this level , which are sold on licences lasting from one to four years . The cost of club tier seats for 2006–07 ranges from £2,500 to £4,750 per season and covers admission to all home league games and any home games Arsenal play in the UEFA Champions League , FA Cup and Carling Cup .
