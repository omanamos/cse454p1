2061 : Odyssey Three is a science fiction novel written by Arthur C. Clarke in 1987 . It is the third book in the Space Odyssey series . Because the Odyssey series is closely concerned with Jupiter and its moons , Clarke had originally intended to delay writing a third book until the Galileo mission to the planet had returned its findings . However , the probe 's launch was delayed in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster so that it would not arrive at Jupiter until 1995 . Deciding not to wait , Clarke instead took his inspiration from the approach of Comet Halley in 1986 and focused his sequel on the comet 's future return , in 2061 . In the previous novel , 2010 : Odyssey Two , Jupiter was converted into a mini - sun which was dubbed " Lucifer " following the Soviet ship Leonov’s mission to Jupiter to find out what happened to the Discovery . A message was sent to Earth by Dave Bowman , through HAL : " ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS , EXCEPT EUROPA . ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE " . This is due to the discovery of alien life in Europa 's ocean , which was frozen over at the surface until Lucifer melted the ice and caused an atmosphere to form . When the Leonov returned to Earth , Heywood Floyd ( whose marriage had broken down while he was on the Leonov ) suffered an accident and had to be shipped up to the orbital space hospital Pasteur for care . His recovery took longer than expected and he became a permanent resident of the space station after finding that his body could no longer handle Earth - level gravity . At the time the novel takes place , Floyd is one of only two remaining survivors of the Leonov mission . His son Chris , who also worked in aeronautics , died a number of years previous in the Copernicus disaster , leaving behind his own son , also named Chris . Now an adult , Chris Floyd II works aboard the spacecraft Galaxy , and has not seen his grandfather in years . Between 2010 and 2061 , there have been several advancements , both technological and political . The USA , USSR and China are now at peace with each other , all nuclear weapons are now under international control , and there is now a Planetary President ( a former monarch , Edward VIII — his country of origin is not specified ) . The black population of South Africa rebelled in the 2030s and formed the United States of Southern Africa ( USSA ) . The white population of South Africa had seen this coming and mostly fled to Europe , taking most of the country 's wealth with them and leaving the black population to rebuild the economy , which they did in a matter of weeks by use of diamonds ( it is worth noting that this book was written in 1987 , at which time South Africa was still federated and apartheid was still in force ) . In the wake of the breakthrough discovery of a new form of muon - catalyzed fusion , space travel has undergone many startling advancements ; with the advent of fusion - powered spacecraft large - scale interplanetary travel is now commercially viable . The largest such corporation is Tsung Spacelines , run by Hong Kong billionaire Sir Lawrence Tsung ( the manufacturers of the crafts Cosmos , Galaxy and—most
