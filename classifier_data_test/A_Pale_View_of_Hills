A Pale View of Hills ( 1982 ) is the first novel by award - winning author Kazuo Ishiguro . This is a story of a Japanese woman named Etsuko now living alone in England , after the suicide of her eldest daughter . Her thoughts , however , are not on her daughter so much as they are on the more distant past , in the mysterious relationship she forms with a woman named Sachiko and her daughter , Mariko , some years before in Japan . A few years later , she meets a British man and gets married . She takes the elder daughter , Keiko , of Jiro and herself to Britain with her new British husband . They have a daughter , and they name her Niki , a name that combines Japanese and English styles . Etsuko does not want to recall the memory of living in Japan , which ended very painfully for her , so she insists to have a western name instead of a Japanese name . But on the other hand , her husband likes the Eastern culture , so in order to make both of them happy , they choose Niki , a name that seems to have both of the styles , to be their daughter 's name . After Etsuko and Keiko move to Britain , Keiko locks herself in her room and does not have any interaction with her family . In the end , perhaps because of the different cultures that make her feel she is isolated from others , she kills herself . Another possible cause of her death is that her mother and her stepfather have their own daughter , so Keiko thinks she doesn’t belong to their family . This much can be reconstructed from the novel 's disjointed narrative . In this novel , Etsuko tells her daughter , Niki , she has a friend named Sachiko , whom she meets in Japan . Sachiko has a daughter named Mariko , a girl that preferred to live without touching the outside world . Sachiko plans to take Mariko to America with an American soldier . Sachiko 's story bears similarities to Etsuko 's . Interpretations of this enigmatic novel vary . One interpretation is that , actually , the story of Sachiko that Etsuko tells Niki is her own story , but because she finds it difficult to tell as her own , she uses the third person narrator to describe her life and her thoughts to her daughter . This interpretation conflicts with the fact that Etsuko does not tell the story to Niki . The novel is written in the form of a private memoir , in which Niki is a character in her own right . Sachiko – woman known to Etsuko , and , possibly , a third person on whom Etsuko projects bad memories , thoughts , and events . Mariko – Sachiko 's daughter , and , possibly , a representation of Etsuko 's daughter , Keiko . This book also describes the relationship between Jiro and his father , Ogata . Jiro is a busy worker , and every time his father wants to chat or play chess with him , he always refuses . Ogata does n't complain , and perhaps even feels bad about tiring his son out . Really , he just wants to spend more time with his son , but Jiro is oblivious . A possible interpretation of the novel is that author wants to bring the transforming Japanese
