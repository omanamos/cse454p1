As an example of the consolidation , Navy officers are sent to learn aeronautical engineering at AFIT , while the Air Force officers learn meteorology at the Naval Postgraduate School . The Graduate School of Engineering and Management which offers degrees in Cost Analysis , Logistics Management , Engineering Mangement , Information Resource Management , aeronautical engineering , applied mathematics , astronautical engineering , computer engineering , computer systems , electrical engineering , operations research , optics , engineering physics , nuclear engineering & meteorology . The School of Systems and Logistics teaches courses in acquisition , logistics , and software engineering . The Civil Engineer and Services School teaches continuing education courses in civil engineering , environmental engineering , and Air Force Services .
