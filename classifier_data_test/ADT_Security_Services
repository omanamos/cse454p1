ADT 's main product is the installation and monitoring of alarm systems , whereby they maintain a centralized monitoring station that receives electronic signals from an alarm system when an alarm event is triggered , such as in the case of an intrusion . A live monitoring specialist examines the data being received from the alarm system and attempts to determine the type of response the alarm signal warrants . In most cases the monitoring specialist will promptly attempt to contact the residence via telephone to investigate further and determine if the signal is a false alarm . Beyond that , if necessary , the monitoring specialist can notify the local police department and / or an authorized security response service of the alarm status and the event address . ADT maintains five monitoring stations in the United States . All text in this section is based on ADT sales literature , so while not being untruthful , will likely not be impartial .
