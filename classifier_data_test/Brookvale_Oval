Brookvale Oval is a sporting ground located at Brookvale , New South Wales , Australia . The ground is owned by Warringah Council and is primarily used by the Manly - Warringah Sea Eagles rugby league team . Brookvale Oval has an approximate capacity of 23,000 people . As of 2006 , Brookvale Oval is the most played - on Australian professional rugby league ground in active usage in the National Rugby League , having hosted over 550 first grade games . In the late nineteenth century , the suburb of Brookvale was known as Greendale . The name Brookvale was later adopted as that was the name of the home built by the original grantee of the land , William Francis Parker . It was in this area that Dan Farrell built his stone house called " Inverness " which was later to become Manly Leagues Club . A block of nearby land called Farrell 's Paddocks was sometimes used for local community events . This land was originally granted to William Redman in 1857 . The original parcel was subsequently subdivided into smaller lots and sold . The change from agricultural use to public recreation did not occur until after the turn of the century following a period of lobbying by local residents for the Government to give the community a park . Farrell’s Paddock was the site of a banquet in 1910 to mark the extension of the tramway from Manly to the village of Brookvale . In the following year , the State Government reached agreement with Warringah Shire Council to acquire land for a park near the Shire’s Offices . The acquired land plus a smaller parcel of land bought from Miss Jane Malcolm ( later known as Jane Try ) from Brookvale , was officially opened in 1911 as Brookvale Park . The Park was transformed into a showground within the first decade . In 1921 , the Brookvale Show was established with the formation of the Warringah Agricultural , Horticultural , Amateur Sports and Athletic Association . Between 1919 and 1928 children from Brookvale School planted trees to commemorate Arbor Day and it was the setting for school sports days and Empire Day picnics . Over fifty annual shows were held at Brookvale Park before the show was moved to St. Ives Showground . Trotting and ring events were features of early shows at Brookvale . The trotting track occupied a substantial area of the Park with lighting of the ring for night entertainment . Substantial improvements were later made to form a sporting oval by the addition of stands . Pavilions were constructed along Alfred Road to house show exhibits . Outside of the annual show period these pavilions were used for local church services and meeting rooms for the local community . They were also used by local bands as a place to practice . During the Second World War Brookvale Park was utilised by the Defence Force for training purposes . While Manly Council favoured rugby union and would not permit league to play at Manly Oval , Warringah Council was more sympathetic to the rugby league cause and encouraged the playing of rugby league matches at Brookvale Park . Thus when the Manly - Warringah Sea Eagles were granted first grade status in 1947 , the team 's first match in the big league was a home game at Brookvale Oval against Western Suburbs . Manly played well against more fancied opponents in that historic first match at Brookvale scoring three tries to one but narrowly losing the match
