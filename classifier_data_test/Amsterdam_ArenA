The Amsterdam ArenA is a stadium in Amsterdam , Netherlands . Initially , it was planned as the centrepiece of Amsterdam 's bid for the 1992 Olympic Games . Amsterdam lost the bid to Barcelona and the plans for the stadium were altered to build a general sports and events arena instead . Today , the stadium is home to football club AFC Ajax , and NFL Europa franchise the Amsterdam Admirals . The stadium , which opened in 1996 , is one of the first in the world to combine a retractable roof with a grass surface . This caused some problems in the beginning : the grass rolls would not grow in the shade of the open roof and had to be replaced up to four times a year . Its all - seated capacity is 51,628 . The estimated cost of the stadium is around € 96 million . The inaugural match was between the home team Ajax and AC Milan . Tina Turner was the first singer who gave a concert in the ArenA during her Wildest Dreams world Tour , with more than 150,000 people attending the three concerts in September 1996 . After the death of Rinus Michels in 2005 , Ajax fans tried to convince the stadium 's board to rebrand the stadium as the Rinus Michels Stadium . The board refused , however at every Ajax home game Ajax fans bring a large banner displaying the words ' Rinus Michels Stadion ' . Despite frequent complaints about the acoustics of the Arena , concerts are often held here . Stars such as Michael Jackson , Tina Turner , David Bowie , Bon Jovi , Eminem , Robbie Williams , Andre Hazes , Red Hot Chili Peppers , The Rolling Stones , Céline Dion , U2 , Metallica and Madonna have played the venue over the years .
