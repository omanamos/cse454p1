The Ateneo de Tuguegarao was a former Jesuit College in Tuguegarao City , Cagayan , Philippines . It was established in 1938 as the Cagayan Valley Atheneum and was renamed Ateneo de Tuguegarao in 1945 after control of the school was handed over to the Society of Jesus . In 1938 , people who identified the title " Ateneo " with a Jesuit school and who knew the Latin parent , if not the meaning , of the word , were surprised and even disturbed that a new school was opening in Northern Luzon under the title of Cagayan Valley Atheneum - - not conducted by the Jesuits . The Cagayan Valley Atheneum was founded by the Most Reverend Constancio Jurgens , C.I.C.M. , bishop of Tuguegarao . From its foundation in 1938 until the war , it was housed in ample buildings adjoining the Cathedral of Tuguegarao . The buildings were destroyed in 1945 and the school reopened in a temporary structure of Nipa and sawali erected in the patio of the pre - war compound . Shortly after its reopening during the school year 1945 - 1946 , the Atheneum was committed by Bishop Jurgens to the direction of the Society of Jesus , and during 1949 - 1950 complete jurisdiction was transferred to the Society , due to the plight of the C.I.C.M. missonaries after the war . In October 1950 , the school was moved to a new site in the southwest section of Tuguegarao . Two buildings were completed in time for occupancy before the second semester of 1950 - 51 - - Loyola Hall , containing classrooms , laboratories , libraries and students ' chapel , and Xavier Hall , with Fathers ' quarters and students dormitory and study hall . A third building , Bellarmine Hall , was completed shortly after the beginning of the semester and used for boarders ' dining room . In 1953 , an Administration building was completed . The Ateneo de Tuguegarao had no Grade School nor was there co - eduaction in any department . A college department was added to the High School in June 1947 . Until 1953 it had only a two - year Pre - Law course and a two - year Commerce course . In 1953 , government recognition of the full four - year Commerce was obtained . It was a small school , and the collegiate offerings were limited to Pre - Law and Commerce courses . The courses have been chosen with regard for local circumstances . The Commerce sourses would prepare the students for local business enterprises . Many of the Pre - Law students went to a law school in Manila and were encouraged by the Ateneo to attend a law school under Catholic auspices , for which , as the records of Ateneo de Tuguegarao pre - law students showed , they have received a solid foundation . Approximately fifty percent of the High School graduates go on to college ; of these approximately two thirds to Manila , while others continue at the Ateneo de Tuguegarao . The Rev. Leo McGovern , S.J. was the first Jesuit Director of the Ateneo de Tuguegarao . He was succeeded in January 1947 by the Rev. Walter F. Hyland , S.J. who remained as Director until July 1948 when the Rev. Ralph M. O'Neill , S.J. was appointed Vice Rector . Father O'Neill became Rector in September 1951 , until succeeded in that office in 1952 by the Rev. Rosalino Pascua , S.J. Father Pascua is to be
