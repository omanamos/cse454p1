A Confederacy of Dunces is a novel written by John Kennedy Toole , published in 1980 , 11 years after the author 's suicide . The book was published through the efforts of the writer Walker Percy ( who also contributed a revealing foreword ) and Toole 's mother , quickly becoming a cult classic . Toole posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1981 . It is an important part of the ' modern canon ' of Southern literature . The title derives from the book 's epigraph by Jonathan Swift : " When a true genius appears in the world , you may know him by this sign , that the dunces are all in confederacy against him. " . The story is set in the city of New Orleans in the early 1960s . The central character is Ignatius J. ( Jacques ) Reilly , an intelligent but slothful man still living with his mother at age 30 in Uptown New Orleans , who , because of family circumstances , must set out to get a job . In his quest for employment he has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters . Ignatius is something of a modern Don Quixote â€” eccentric , idealistic , and creative , sometimes to the point of delusion . He disdains modernity , particularly pop culture . The disdain becomes his obsession : he goes to movies in order to mock their inanity and express his outrage with the contemporary world 's lack of " theology and geometry. " . He prefers the scholastic philosophy of the Middle Ages , especially that of Boethius . However he is also seen as enjoying many modern comforts and conveniences , and is given to claiming that the rednecks of rural Louisiana hate all modern technology which they associate with progress . Ignatius operates under the mindset that he does not belong in the world and that his numerous failings are the work of some higher power . He continually refers to the goddess Fortuna as having spun him downwards on her wheel of luck . Ignatius is a glutton and becomes sexually aroused by thoughts of his deceased dog and when he is lifted into the air by four black factory workers . His mockery of obscene images is portrayed as a defensive posture to hide their titillating effect on him . In addition , he exhibits bizarre aversions , for example to Greyhound Scenicruiser buses , the bi - level coaches the company used at the time for its longer routes . He speaks of the horror he feels even just knowing that they are hurtling about in the night . Myrna " The Minx " is a Jewish beatnik from New York City whom Ignatius met while she was in college in New Orleans . Though their political , social , religious , and personal orientations could hardly be more different , Myrna and Ignatius fascinate one another . Repeated reference is made to the tag - team attack on the teachings of the professors Myrna and Ignatius engaged in during their college years . For most of the novel she is seen only in the regular correspondence which the two sustain since her return to New York , a correspondence heavily weighted with sexual analysis on the part of Myrna and contempt for her apparent sacrilegious activity by Ignatius . Officially , they both deplore everything the other stands for . Though neither of them will admit it , their correspondence indicates that , though
