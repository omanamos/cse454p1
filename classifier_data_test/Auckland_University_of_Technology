The Auckland University of Technology ( AUT University ) ( Māori : Te Wananga Aronui o Tāmaki Makau Rau ) is the newest university in New Zealand . It was formed on 1 January 2000 when the Auckland Institute of Technology was granted university status . Its primary campus is on Wellesley Street in Auckland 's Central business district ( CBD ) . A secondary campus is at Akoranga on the North Shore . AUT also has a Technology Park in Penrose , Auckland . AUT was originally founded as Auckland Technical School in 1895 , offering evening classes only . Daytime classes began in 1906 . In 1913 it was renamed Seddon Memorial Technical College , and it was renamed again as the Auckland Technical Institute ( ATI ) in 1960 . In 1989 the name changed to Auckland Institute of Technology ( AIT ) , and the current name was adopted when university status was granted in 2000 . In 2006 AUT had 22,000 students . A significant proportion were studying Bachelors degree or above ( 64.2 % ) and were full - time ( 64 % ) , giving a total of 15,382 full time equivalent students . Approximately 2,980 international students attended the university in 2006 . In 2006 there were 942 full time equivalent academic staff and 828 full time equivalent administrative and support staff . The process through which AUT was recognised as a university was controversial , as ( for instance ) it had an inadequate library at the time , and some students were given access to the University of Auckland 's library as a stopgap measure . AUT 's library grew rapidly and its size was not a significant factor with respect to the disciplines in which AUT taught and researched . Despite controversial beginnings , the university is now well established . It promotes itself as an advocate of innovative approaches to teaching , learning and research . In particular its focus is on providing a pragmatic ' real world ' approach , ensuring excellence in learning , teaching and developing outstanding graduates for practice in their chosen fields . In practice this reflects the continuing survival of vocational type courses and an emphasis upon student development towards employment . For this reason links with employers continue to be fostered . AUT claims that it maintains very high levels of graduate employment in comparison to other NZ universities , though the statistical basis for this claim has been disputed . Since becoming a university , AUT has invested heavily in infrastructure , staffing and programmes . It is half way through its $245 million building programme on both the Wellesley and Akoranga Campuses . Since 2000 , new engineering , design , library , and business buildings have been constructed . AUT has two campuses - Wellesley ( Auckland CBD ) and Akoranga ( North Shore ) . AUT also maintains its own technology park in Penrose , Auckland City . Plans are also in place for a third campus in Manukau City . The Wellesley campus spreads over several sites in the heart of central Auckland . The main campus is situated on Mayoral Drive , Wellesley Street , Symond and St Paul Street . The Faculties of Applied Humanities , Business , Design and Creative Technologies , and Te Ara Poutama , and the Applied Sciences division share this location . The Applied Humanities and Design and Creative Technologies faculties also share a building on the corner of Wakefield Street and Rutland Street . The Akoranga campus is
