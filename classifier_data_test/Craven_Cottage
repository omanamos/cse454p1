Craven Cottage is the name of a sports stadium in the Hammersmith and Fulham area that has been the home ground of the football team Fulham F.C. since 1896 . Its capacity has recently been increased to around 24,600 with the highest Fulham Premiership home attendance of 24,554 fans present for the 1 - 0 victory against Liverpool F.C. on 5 May 2007 . Fulham are renowned for their special bond with Craven Cottage , as many fans view the ground as being the epitome of what the club stands for . The stadium has one of the most picturesque settings in league football , located next to Bishops Park on the banks of the River Thames . A view of the ground from the Putney End . The original ' Cottage ' was built in 1780 , by William Craven , the sixth Baron Craven and was located on the centre circle of the pitch . At the time , the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of Anne Boleyn 's hunting grounds . Several other sports are presumed to have taken place here besides hunting . As well as more lethargic games such as lawn bowls and croquet , a version of the Aztec game called ' tlachtli ' ( scoring a ball through a hoop using your hips ) is alleged to have been played here .

Therefore , The Cottagers have had 10 grounds overall ( if including Loftus Road ) meaning only their ' landlords ' and rival QPR has had more home grounds ( 14 ) in British football . Of particular note , was Ranelagh House , Fulham 's palatial home from 1886 - 1888 . When representatives of Fulham first came across the land , in 1894 , it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it . A deal had been done that meant this work was done by the owners of the ground , who then would receive a proportion of the gate receipts . The first event at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against Minerva in the Middlesex Senior Cup , on October 10 1886 . The ground 's first stand was built shortly after . Described as looking like an " orange box " , it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats , and later was affectionately nicknamed the " Rabbit hutch " . Before the ground could become too well established , the now defunct London County Council became concerned with the level of safety at the ground , and tried to get it closed .
