Aquinas College , located on a 107 - acre wooded campus in Grand Rapids , Michigan , is a small , Catholic college that aims to provide a liberal arts education with a global perspective . Noted for its academic rigor and challenging professors , Aquinas is consistently considered one of the best liberal arts colleges in the Midwest region by U.S. News and World Report ( 2006 ) . Aquinas has over 2,300 students and offers 58 majors , awarding Bachelor 's degrees and Master 's degrees . It is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and a member of the North Central Association . Many Aquinas graduates go on to graduate schools : approximately 95 % of pre - med students from Aquinas are accepted at various medical schools around the country ( aquinas.edu ) . The opportunity to study abroad is a huge draw to Aquinas students , as many take a semester at an international university . Founded by the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids in 1886 , Aquinas has a Catholic heritage . Aquinas began as a novitiate normal school , for young women who had yet to take their vows to the Dominican religious order . In 1922 , the Dominican Sisters merged their newly created college for lay women with the normal school . This new college received a charter from the state of Michigan to grant degrees in 1923 . In 1931 , it became the first Catholic college in the US to go co - ed , and was reorganized as Catholic Junior College . The college began to operate as a four - year institution in 1941 , when it was renamed in honor of Saint Thomas Aquinas . The school 's first administrator was Monsignor Bukowski , for whom the school 's chapel is named . Following Bukowski was Norbert Hruby , for which Hruby Hall , an administrative building and computer lab , holds his name . After Hruby came Peter O'Connor , who served from 1986 until 1990 . R. Paul Nelson became the fourth President , serving until 1997 , when he resigned , and was succeeded by President Harry Knopke . Knopke served from 1997 through 2006 . Provost Ed Balog has served as interim president since 2006 and will become the 6th President on July 1st , 2007 . Notable Board of Trustees members include Chairman Thomas Church , Vice - Chair Patrick Miles , Jr. , Secretary Debra Bailey , and Treasurer Lanny Thodey , as well as Rev. William Duncan , Vicar General of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids . Trustees Emeritus include Sr. M. Aquinas Weber , a notable figure on campus , and local philanthropist Peter Wege . Nelson , a St. Bernard , is the mascot of the Aquinas Saints . Aquinas is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) , and the Wolverine - Hoosier Athletic Conference . As Aquinas has never fielded a football team , the men 's and women 's soccer and basketball teams prove big draws . The Athletic Department is led by long - time men 's baseball coach Terry Bocian , who retired from coaching in 2002 to focus solely on his duties as athletic director . Aquinas College teams have been national runner - up twice . In 1963 , the Aquinas men 's golf team narrowly lost to host Southwest Missouri State in the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division II tournament .
