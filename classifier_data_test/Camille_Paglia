Camille Anna Paglia ( born April 2 , 1947 in Endicott , New York ) is an American social critic , intellectual , author and teacher . She is a professor of humanities and media studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Paglia completed her undergraduate studies at Binghamton University and later , her graduate studies at Yale . She has been variously called the " feminist that other feminists love to hate , " a " post - feminist feminist , " one of the world 's top 100 intellectuals by the UK 's Prospect Magazine , and by her own description " a feminist bisexual egomaniac. " . Paglia is an intellectual of many seeming contradictions : an atheist who respects religion , a classicist who champions art both high and low , with a view that human nature has an inherently dangerous Dionysian aspect , especially the wilder , darker sides of human sexuality . She came to public attention in 1990 , with the publication of her first book , Sexual Personae : Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson . Her notoriety as the author of this book made it possible for her to write on popular culture and feminism in mainstream newspapers and magazines . Paglia the public intellectual challenged the so - called " liberal establishment " of the day that ruled the roost in media , academia , activism , and politics , including figures such as Gloria Steinem , Andrea Dworkin , prominent academics , and advocacy groups such as National Organization for Women and ACT UP . Paglia describes herself as a feminist , and as a Democrat who voted for Bill Clinton and Ralph Nader , and even campaigned for John F. Kennedy as an adolescent . Her views on the legalization of recreational drugs and prostitution , and on the relaxation of sexual consent laws , are more libertarian . She is a strong critic of much of the feminism that began with Betty Friedan 's 1962 The Feminine Mystique , and compared feminists — whom she considered to be victim - centered — to the Unification Church . At the same time , Paglia 's libertarian and Dionysian sexual world view , embracing fetishism , pornography , prostitution , and most prominently , male homosexuality , puts her at odds with the " family values " of American social conservatives . Fiercely critical of the influence certain French philosophers and theorists ( including Jacques Lacan , Jacques Derrida , Helene Cixous , and Michel Foucault ) have had on the humanities in the USA , she favors a curriculum grounded in comparative religion , art history , and the literary canon , with a greater emphasis on facts in the teaching of history . Her allies and supporters ( for different reasons ) include Andrew Sullivan , Christina Hoff Sommers , Rush Limbaugh , Bill Maher , Matt Drudge , and her Yale mentor Harold Bloom . Elise Sutton , a dominatrix advocating female domination of males , describes Paglia as a female supremacist and a friend . In September 2005 , she ranked number 20 in a list of the world 's " Top 100 Public Intellectuals " compiled by the editors of the American journal Foreign Policy and the UK journal The Prospect . The list included 10 women , including feminist thinkers such as Germaine Greer , Martha Nussbaum , and Julia Kristeva . Paglia has written a column for Salon.com from its inception in 1995 . She
