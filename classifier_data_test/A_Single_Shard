A Single Shard is the winner of the 2002 Newbery Medal , awarded for excellence in children 's literature . The novel was written by Linda Sue Park , and is set in 12th - century Korea . The book tells the story of Tree - ear , an orphan who lives under a bridge with a disabled old man named Crane - man . They live near a village named Ch'ulp'o , a potter 's village . Tree - ear 's dream is to become a potter , but pottery is a craft that is passed down from father to son , and as an orphan he has no one to teach him the trade . He begins to secretly watch Min , the village pottery master , as he works at creating beautiful celadon pottery . He accidentally breaks a piece of Min 's pottery and must work for him to pay off the debt . Once the debt is paid , Min grudgingly allows Tree - ear to work for him in exchange for food . One day , an emissary named Kim arrives to hire a potter for a new commission for the palace . While spying on other potters in the village , Tree - ear learns of a newly created technique and must decide if it is ethical to reveal the stolen information to Min . He decides not to but Min does get a chance to demonstrate that he can use the new inlay technique and sends Tree - ear to the emperor with samples of his best work . On route to the royal court at Songdo , the boy is attacked by robbers , and all of the pots are smashed , leaving him with just a single shard to display his master 's skill . He continues his journey , confident that the shard demonstrates that his master is worthy of the commission . The emissary 's assistant is about to throw Tree - ear out when Kim inspects the shard . Unsurprisingly , Kim is impressed at Min 's work . Kim sends Tree - ear back via sea . Tree - ear goes to his master to inform him that Kim ( the emissary ) likes his work . Unfortunately , after sharing the news , Tree - ear learns Crane - man died while he was away and quickly becomes sad . Min decides to adopt Tree - ear and his wife changes his name to Hyung - pil ( his dead son was Hyung - gu and Tree - ear 's new name shares a syllable , as Korean siblings ' names commonly do ) . Tree - ear is finally able to learn how to make pottery .
