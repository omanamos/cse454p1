A Short History of Pakistan is an edited book published by University of Karachi Press and comprises four volumes . The book is edited by Prof Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi and provides a comprehensive account of the history of the Pakistan region and its people from the prehistory leading to the creation of Pakistan . Complete set of four volumes are sequentially titled as , Book One : Pre - Muslim Period by Ahmad Hasan Dani ; Book Two : Muslim Rule under the Sultans by M. Kabir ; Book Three : The Mughul Empire by Sh. A. Rashid ; and , Book Four : Alien Rule and the Rise of Muslim Nationalism by M. A. Rahim et al . This book is significant as probably the first serious attempt to paint an overall picture of the early history of what is now Pakistan . Given that the book deals with periods of history prior to the creation of Pakistan , it has been described as , point of fact , a history of the northern part of the entire Indian Subcontinent with special emphasis on the region that presently is Pakistan . Some of the essays have been criticized by peer reviewers as being insufficiently objective about relations between Indian Muslims , Hindus and the British political classes . Critique by Arthur Llewellyn Basham : Author of the first volume , Prof A. H. Dani is not only an expert archaeologist and prehistorian , but also an able Sanskritist with a very important study of Indian palaeography to his credit . Its interest for the non - Pakistani reader lies chiefly in the attempt to find common factors in the ancient culture of what is now Pakistan . Although a great treasure of ancient Buddhist artefacts is discovered , no significant specimen of Mauryan Empire and Mauryan art is to be found in Pakistan . Gupta Empire also had little influence here . Critique by Philip B. Calkins : This volume gives a survey of the history of the Sultanate period . After an introductory chapter which describes some of the sources for the history of the period , nine chapters are devoted to an account of the Sultanate , its Muslim antecedents in Sindh and Afghanistan , and the independent Muslim kingdoms which developed out of it . The final chapter deals with administration , society and culture . Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this volume is historiographical rather than historical , since it is part of a series of Pakistan and Muslims since their arrival in the sub - continent . Calkins , criticizes the treatment in this volume as " not very deep " . He also questions it 's objectivity by calling it " the official Pakistani point of view " . Critique by Fritz Lehman : Given that this book is intended as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates , Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India , yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given . Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing . The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications . Assessment of the Marathas , for example , while unsympathetic is fair to the facts . Lehman criticizes the volume 's implications that Muslims living under " Hindu rule " was " the worst disaster in the history of Islam in South Asia " , a view he describes as '
