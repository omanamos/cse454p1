A World Lit Only by Fire ( 1992 ) by American historian William Manchester , is an informal history of the European Middle Ages . The book is structured into three sections : The Medieval Mind , The Shattering , and One Man Alone . The opening section , The Medieval Mind , extensively covers notable occurrences centered in approximately in the year 500 , including a lavish description of the fall of the Roman Empire and the reasons for its fall . Manchester then continues , delineating why " Europe was troubled since " the Empire 's demise . He speaks of the Dark Ages that immediately followed the collapse of the Roman Empire , including details regarding a number of adverse events that were characteristic of what Manchester notes as a " stark " era . He speaks of the Black Death as well as various " climatic changes , " such as severe flooding , that socially and economically brought ruin to the already frail condition that many European nations resorted to after the Roman Empire ceased to exist . The second section of the work , The Shattering , is the book 's most extensive section ; expanding upon a great deal of happenings that embodied the latter end of the Middle Ages as well as the early period of the Renaissance . Manchester in this section focuses primarily upon the corruption of the Catholic Church . He attacks many medieval clergymen , including numerous popes , speaking of inappropriate financial and carnal acts . He relates extensive anecdotes regarding a pope from the formidable medieval Borgia family , Pope Alexander VI , speaking of " wild " celebrations and extensive nepotism exercised by this pope . In conjunction with his inscriptions on the state of the Vatican , or the " Holy See , " Manchester also speaks in depth about the Protestant Reformation as led by former Catholic monk Martin Luther . Continuing with his focus in regards to spirituality , he writes on the rise of humanism in the early Renaissance days and its celebration of secularism over piety . He covers humanist scholars , and concentrates upon the humanist tendencies of Renaissance leaders such as Michelangelo and Da Vinci . Speaking also of the European nobility of the era , Manchester elaborately describes the life and decisions made by England 's King Henry VIII . He writes of Henry 's wives and the King 's eventual separation from the Church despite his being once , according to Manchester , an " ardent Catholic. " . The final section of the work , One Man Alone , is a description of the voyage of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan , who circumnavigated the globe . Manchester fully expands upon the life and personality of Magellan , his setbacks , and his eventual death in the Philippines in an attempt to convert the natives to Catholicism there . His argument is ultimately that Magellan 's voyage was concurrent with and , on several levels , symptomatic of the shattering of what he defines as the medieval mind . A World Lit Only By Fire is an informative read , yet as its purpose does not possess educational intentions , it tends to include humor , perspectives , biases , and anecdotes that readers may consider not to be objective .
