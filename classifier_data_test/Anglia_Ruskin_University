Anglia Ruskin University , formerly Anglia Polytechnic , is a university in England , with campuses in Cambridge and Chelmsford . Anglia Ruskin University has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art opened in 1858 by John Ruskin , which became the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology from 1960 . This merged with the Essex Institute of Higher Education in 1989 to form the Anglia Higher Education College . The merged college became a polytechnic in 1991 , going by the name Anglia Polytechnic , which was then awarded university status in 1992 . Wanting to keep the " APU " abbreviation , a suggestion put forward by the governors was " Anglia Prior University " ( after a former Chancellor ) , but the Governors decided to keep polytechnic in the title . The University eventually reconsidered a name change , because " Nowadays , few remember the old polytechnics and technical colleges , and there no longer any added value to students or faculty in retaining the word ‘polytechnic’ in title . Indeed , it sometimes seen as a hindrance , especially in non - vocational subject areas. " . From over two hundred suggestions and consultations with staff , students and local residents , communities and businesses , the University chose Anglia Ruskin University , with the new name taking effect following the approval of the Privy Council on 29 September 2005 .
