A London Life is a novella by Henry James , first published in Scribner 's Magazine in 1888 . The plot revolves around a crumbling marriage and its impact on many other people , especially Laura Wing , the sister of the soon - to - be - divorced wife . Laura is a classic Jamesian " central consciousness , " whose reflections and emotions color the presentation of the storyline and the other characters . The tale is notable for its straightforward , even hard - edged approach to sexuality and divorce . This might reflect the influence of French naturalism on James during the 1880s . Laura Wing , an impoverished American girl , is visiting her sister Selina Berrington in London . Selina 's husband Lionel , boorish and often drunk , is preparing to divorce his wife for her adultery with Charlie Crispin . Laura challenges Selina about her affair and doubts Selina 's protestations of innocence . Lady Davenant , an elderly friend of the family , counsels Laura not to take her sister 's marital troubles so hard . Laura meets a pleasant but boring American named Wendover , who becomes a suitor . Eventually , after a tempestuous and ( for the reader ) entertaining scene at the opera , Selina leaves her husband and goes to Brussels with Crispin . Laura spurns Wendover 's marriage proposal and pursues her sister to Brussels , where she accomplishes nothing . Laura finally goes back to America , where Wendover follows her though there is no assurance as to how their future will play out . The story ends with a reminder that the case of Berrington v. Berrington and others is upcoming in the courts . The rather Victorian adjective " unpleasant " has been applied to this story , much as it was long ago used for the products of Emile Zola and other French naturalists . James certainly tells his story in a blunt fashion , with no illusions about the delicacy or virtue of the Berringtons . The reader can sympathise with neither the oafish husband nor the sluttish wife . Even Laura Wing , the Jamesian central intelligence , is presented as extreme in her horrified reaction to the breakup of this distasteful couple . Lady Davenant tries to supply a much needed dose of common sense to Laura when she advises that Selina and Lionel are n't worth the bother . The atmosphere of the story is similar to the corrupt and irresponsible milieu of What Maisie Knew , and Laura simply ca n't abide the inevitable sleaziness of , well , a London life . She proves completely ineffective in her attempts to save a marriage not worth saving , and her eventual flight to America is a sad admission of defeat . Although several of the characters are American , James makes nothing of the international contrast . Many critics have wondered why James bothered with such an odd echo of his international theme , when all the characters could easily have been English without affecting the story in any way . Edmund Wilson liked this story for its no - nonsense approach to the realities of a marital breakup . He classed it as part of what he saw as James 's best period , when the novelist " reaches what seems to me indisputably his completist artistic maturity : he has got over a certain stiffness , a certain naivete , which characterized his earlier work and he has acquired a new flexibility and a
