The Alamodome is a multi - purpose facility that is primarily used as a football / basketball stadium and convention center in San Antonio , Texas , USA . The facility opened on May 15 , 1993 , at a cost of $186 million . It was constructed after voters in 1989 approved a five - year , half - cent sales tax increase that was collected by eventual owner VIA Metropolitan Transit , the local transit authority . Upon completion of the facility , it was nearly debt free and showed a net operating profit within its first two years of operation . On June 9 , 1994 , ownership of the Alamodome was transferred from the transit authority to the City of San Antonio . The general contractor for the Alamodome and adjacent transit facility was Lyda Swinerton Builders , the Texas subsidiary of the San Francisco - based Swinerton Inc . On April 15 , 2005 , the San Antonio City Council voted to spend close to $6.5 million to renovate the Alamodome in an effort to lure a Major League Soccer franchise to the city . After the election of Phil Hardberger as the new mayor , those efforts were abandoned , though the approved renovations to the facility will continue as planned . The city administration and local business leaders have re - focused their efforts to bringing an NFL franchise to San Antonio . On April 19 , 2007 , the San Antonio City Council unanimously voted for $8.3 million in renovations and enhancements to the Alamodome . Although when the Alamodome was built it was an ideal state - of - the - art NFL stadium , by today 's standards the facility would have to undergo renovations and add a considerable number of luxury suites in order to make it a profitable venue for an NFL team . Preliminary estimates put the cost of improvements at $100 - 150 million . The facility is a rectilinear three - level stadium which can seat up to 65,000 spectators for a typical football game but is expandable to hold 72,000 spectators , allowing the possibility to host a Super Bowl . The arena configuration ( basketball / hockey ) takes 12 - 18 hours to set up retractable seating and install the playing surface . In this configuration , typically only the two lower levels at one or both ends of the facility are used . The arena configuration seats 20,662 spectators , but capacity can be expanded to 36,500 when the upper level is opened . The Alamodome opened with 38 luxury suites and 6,000 club level seats . The original design specifications called for 66 luxury suites . But since the San Antonio Spurs were the only occupant at the time , only 38 luxury suites in the north end of the facility were built ( where the basketball court was placed , and a curtain separated it from the south end ) . The footprints for the 28 unbuilt luxury suites were open floor space just behind the club level seats that surround the south end of the facility . In 2006 , the Alamodome underwent an expansion to accommodate 14 new luxury suites , increasing the number of suites to 52 . The Sports Club and the Top of the Dome restaurant also received renovations in 2004 . The Alamodome has two permanent Olympic - size ice rinks that can be used for NHL games , figure skating and speed skating . The facility also contains 30,000 square feet of
