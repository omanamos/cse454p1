William Hybels ( born 1952 , Kalamazoo , Michigan ) is the founding and senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington , Illinois . Willow Creek 's numerous ministries have made it one of the most attended churches in North America , with an average attendance of 17,115 as of 2003 . He is the founder of the Willow Creek Association of " seeker sensitive " churches . Hybels is also an author of a number of Christian books , especially on the subject of Christian leadership . Hybels has a bachelor 's degree in Biblical Studies and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School . In the early 1970s , Hybels was studying at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School when Gilbert Bilezikian , a lecturer , challenged the class about an Acts 2 - based church . Hybels was captivated with the vision and abandoned his business aspirations for ministry . In 1972 , Bill Hybels , youth pastor at Park Ridge 's South Park Church , started a youth group with friend Dave Holmbo called Son City . Modern music , dramatic skits and multimedia were combined with Bible studies in relevant language helped the group grow from 25 to 1,200 in just three years . After 300 youth waited in line to be led to Christ in a service in May 1974 , Hybels and other leaders began dreaming of forming a new church . They surveyed the community to find out why people were n't coming to church . Common answers included : " church is boring " , " they're always asking for money " , or " I do n't like being preached down to. " . These answers shaped the group 's approach to the new church . In October , 12 , 1975 the group held their first service Palatine 's Willow Creek Theater . 125 people attended the service . The rent and other costs were paid for with 1,200 baskets of tomatoes , sold door - to - door by 100 teenagers . Hybels spoke on " New beginnings " Within two years the church had grown to 2,000 . Challenges in 1979 led to a recommissioning of the church 's vision to be broader and deeper than before . Hybels apologised for the example of his relentless schedule and overemphasis on grace . In 1981 the church moved to its current location in South Barrington . By 2000 , 15,000 were attending weekly services over six weekend services in a 352,000 - square - foot building . In 1991 , concerns about the large church maintaining community led to the adoption of a cell - based approach . The church now has over 2,600 groups focusing on a broad range of needs . Willow Creek Community Church has become well - known as the prototypical megachurch , with modern worship , drama and messages focused toward the unchurched . Willow Creek 's four weekend services are " seeker sensitive " , with the mid - week " new community " services providing teaching for believers . In 1992 Hybels launched the Willow Creek Association ( WCA ) of what are called seeker sensitive churches . This has since grown into a network of over 11,000 churches worldwide . Hybels has largely avoided association with specific political parties or movements . However , he received some criticism when at a leadership conference hosted by the WCA in 2000 , he interviewed Rich DeVos ( Amway co - founder ) and carried out a 90 -
