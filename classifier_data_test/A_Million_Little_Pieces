A Million Little Pieces is a mostly - fabricated memoir by James Frey . It tells the story of a 23 - year - old alcoholic and drug abuser and how he copes with rehabilitation in a Twelve Steps - oriented treatment center . Released widely on April 15,2003 by Doubleday Books , a division of Random House , the book garnered international attention after it was reported in January 2006 , that the book contained outright fabrications and was not , as originally represented by the author and publisher , a completely factual memoir . Before the falsities of his book were reported , the book received mixed feedback . While some critics , such as Pat Conroy praised the book , calling it " the War and Peace of addiction , " others were not as impressed by the gruesome nature of the book and Frey 's overall attitude that sets the tone for the book . For example , critic Julian Keeling , a former addict , stated that " Frey 's stylistic tactics are irritating . . .none of this makes the reader feel well - disposed towards him " . Also , author Heather King said that " A Million Little Pieces rings false " . In September of 2005 , the book became an Oprah 's Book Club selection . The book shortly thereafter was the number one paperback " non - fiction " book on the New York Times Best Seller list for 15 straight weeks and quickly became the number 1 book on Amazon.com . By January 28 , 2006 , it had fallen to number four on the Amazon.com list with Winfrey 's following selection , Night by Elie Wiesel , taking over the top position . A notable feature of this book is its lack of quotation marks to indicate direct discourse . Instead , a new line is started each time . The fact that the author uses this same style to indicate his internal thoughts , often interspersed between direct discourse from himself and others , gives the book a unique and sometimes confusing writing style , purportedly reflecting the nature of his experience in the treatment center . Frey makes frequent use of this stream of consciousness writing technique , which allows the reader to better understand his version of the events . Frey 's unique writing style also involves his capitalizing random nouns throughout the book for No Apparent Reason . Frey also uses heavy repetition of words throughout the text , which is consistent with his repetitive use of alcohol and drugs as well as his repetitive run - ins with the authorities . A film adaptation was said to be in development with Mark Romanek attached to direct . Since the disclosure in January 2006 that much of the book is fiction , there are questions about whether the film will be made . The book begins with a badly tattered James waking on an airplane to Chicago , with no recollection of his injuries or of how he ended up on the plane . He is met by his parents at the airport , who eventually decide to take him to a rehabilitation clinic . We find out that James is 23 years old , and has been an alcoholic , drug addict and criminal for roughly 10 years of his life . He is also wanted by the police in three different states on several , serious charges . As he checks into his rehab clinic , he is forced to quit
