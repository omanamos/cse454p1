Carlos Drummond de Andrade ( October 31 , 1902 - August 17 , 1987 ) was perhaps the most influential Brazilian poet of the 20th century . He has become something of a national poet ; his poem " Canção Amiga " ( " Friendly Song " ) was printed on the 50 cruzados note . Drummond was born in Itabira , a mining village in Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil . His parents were farmers of Portuguese ancestry ( and remote Scottish ancestry ) . He went to a school of pharmacy in Belo Horizonte , but never worked as a pharmacist after graduation . He worked in government service for most of his life , eventually becoming director of history for the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Service of Brazil . Though his earliest poems are formal and satirical , Drummond quickly adopted the new forms of Brazilian modernism that were evolving in the 1920s , incited by the work of Mário de Andrade ( to whom he was not related ) . He adopted a Whitmanian free verse , mingling speech fluent in elegance and truth about the surrounding , many times quotidian , world , with a fluidity of thought . One of Drummond 's best - known poems is his hymn to an ordinary man , " José. " . The work of Carlos Drummond is generally divided into several segments , which appear very markedly in each of his books . But this is somewhat misleading , since even in the midst of his everyday poems or his socialist , politicized poems , there appear creations which can be easily incorporated into his later metaphysical canon , and none of these styles is completely free of the others . There is surely much metaphysical content in even his most rancid political poems . The most prominent of these later metaphysical poems is A Máquina do Mundo ( The Machine of the World ) . The poem deals with an anti - Faust referred to in the first person , who receives the visit of the aforementioned Machine , which stands for all possible knowledge , and the sum of the answers for all the questions which afflict men ; in highly dramatic and baroque versification the poem develops only for the anonymous subject to decline the offer of endless knowledge and proceed his gloomy path in the solitary road . It takes the renaissance alegory of the Machine of the World from Portugal 's most esteemed poet , Luís de Camões , more precisely , from a canto at the end of his epic masterpiece Os Lusíadas . There are also hints from Dante and the form is adapted from T. S. Eliot 's dantesque passage in " Little Gidding. " . Drummond is a favorite of American poets , a number of whom , including Mark Strand and Lloyd Schwartz , have translated him . Later writers and critics have sometimes credited his relationship with Elizabeth Bishop , his first English language translator , as influential for his American reception , but though she admired him Bishop claimed she barely knew him . I did n't know him at all . He 's supposed to be very shy . I'm supposed to be very shy . We've met once — on the sidewalk at night . We had just come out of the same restaurant , and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced . The Elephant , translated by Mark Strand . From Ploughshares , 1975 . In the Middle
