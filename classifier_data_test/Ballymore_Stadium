Ballymore Stadium is the name of a rugby union stadium situated in Herston , a suburb of Brisbane , Australia . It is also the home of Queensland Rugby Union , and was the home ground for the Queensland Reds and the Brisbane Strikers Soccer Club . The Queensland Reds have since moved to Suncorp Stadium and the Brisbane Strikers moved to Perry Park before folding . The QRU set up headquarters at Ballymore in 1966 under a deed of grant from the state government . The first club game played at the new site was a match between Teachers and Wests . The QRU then officially moved in February 1967 . In March of the following year Ballymore 's grandstand was officially opened . The Eastern Stand was opened on June 21 , 1992 . The ground exceeded capacity in 1993 when 26,000 squeezed in to watch the Wallabies play South Africa . A year later the first match under lights was played at the ground . Today the grandstand is known as the McLean Stand ( named in 1980 ) , and the Eastern stand is known as the Bank of QLD stand . In 2006 it was announced that there was a new proposal to turn Ballymore into a state - of - the - art training facility for Australian rugby , for teams throughout the Asia - Pacific region . The proposed development would also include a Rugby hall of Fame , and an archive for the preservation of rugby history and memorabilia . The QRU said that the Australian Rugby Union ( ARU ) , the state government and the Brisbane City Council all supported conducting a feasibility study . It will apparently share traits with the French Rugby Federation 's Centre National de Rugby , which is near Paris . The QRU proposed that the training centre be built on the land adjacent to the headquarters at Ballymore . The new complex would include advanced sports medicine and training facilities , a gymnasium and aquatic facilities , as well as on - site accommodation for visiting teams . Though the Reds have since moved out of Ballymore , to the Suncorp Stadium , which has double capacity , Ballymore is still the host to many rugby union matches . The Queensland Club rugby final is usually held at the ground , and Queensland XVs and off - season matches for the Reds are also played at Ballymore . The Reds will also play both of their home games during the 2006 Australian Provincial Championship at Ballymore . It is also likely that both of Brisbane 's teams in the new national competition being launched in 2006 will play out of Ballymore . In late 2006 , it was hinted that the Queensland Roar of the A - League may move to Ballymore , as they have been getting just 10,000 to low 20,000s in a 50,000 plus Suncorp Stadium , and not being able to keep up with the high price of playing there .
