Catherine Webb ( born 1986 ) is a British author , educated at the Godolphin and Latymer School , London , and the London School of Economics . Catherine Webb was just fourteen years old when she completed Mirror Dreams , written during her school summer holidays . The book was published in 2002 , and Webb was soon named Young Trailblazer of the Year by the magazine Cosmo Girl . Since then , she has gone on to write more books and has been favourably compared with Terry Pratchett ( one of her literary heroes ) and Philip Pullman . She has now published six novels , all with Atom Books , and is a third - year history student at the London School of Economics . Webb prides herself on the scientific and historical accuracy of her Horatio Lyle books , which have been acclaimed by reviewers and readers . A lifelong Londoner , she enjoys walking through the areas she describes in her books - Bethnal Green , Clerkenwell and along the River Thames - comparing the city of London as it is now to how it was at various times in the past .
