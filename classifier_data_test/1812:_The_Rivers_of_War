1812 : The Rivers of War is a 2005 alternate history novel by American writer Eric Flint . The book was originally published in hardcover as simply The Rivers of War . In 2006 , the text was made available at the Baen Free Library . The story , which takes place in 1814â€“15 , centers around an alternate historical version of the War of 1812 . The point of divergence is at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend , where Sam Houston , who was seriously injured in real history , sustains only a minor injury and is able to continue fighting . This leads to many changes down the line , culminating in the formation of the Confederacy of the Arkansas . Much of the novel , like many of Eric Flint 's novels , focuses on the motivations of those involved in warfare . British general Robert Ross is a viewpoint character in the novel , and much time is devoted to his place as a " gentleman soldier " , leading the English forces . Another strong theme in the book is that of Indian rights . During the early part of the 19th century , westward expansion was squeezing the Cherokee and other Indian nations out of lands they occupied east of the Mississippi River . In the novel , the characters all seem to have a sense of inevitability about the whole affair , and know the time to preserve what they have is limited .
