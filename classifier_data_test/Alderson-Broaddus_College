Alderson - Broaddus College , informally known as " A - B " , is a private , four - year liberal arts college affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the West Virginia Baptist Convention located in Philippi , West Virginia , USA . Alderson - Broaddus was formed in 1932 by the union of two Baptist institutions : Alderson Academy ( founded 1901 ) and Broaddus College ( founded 1871 ; moved to Philippi , 1901 ) . Noted for its health science , natural science , education and music programs , the college offers a variety of majors in five academic divisions : Education and Special Programs , Health Sciences , Humanities , Natural Sciences and Social Sciences . The college sponsors The West Virginians , a premier touring music ensemble offering sacred and secular music as ambassadors of the college and the state of West Virginia . The college 's sports teams are known as the " Battlers " ( harkening back to the Battle of Philippi ) , the colors are blue and gold , and they compete in the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference , a member of the NCAA 's Division II . Alderson - Broaddus College derives its hyphenated name from the merging of two Baptist institutions in 1932 . The older of the two , Broaddus College , was founded in Winchester , Virginia in 1871 by Edward Jefferson Willis , a Baptist minister who named the new college after Rev. William Francis Ferguson Broaddus , a prominent Baptist minister at the time of the Civil War . In response to economic hard times , Broaddus College was moved across the Alleghenies to Clarksburg , West Virginia , in 1876 . The college was moved again to the small town of Philippi in 1901 . The other institution , Alderson Academy and Junior College , was founded in Alderson , West Virginia in 1901 by Emma Alderson , a committed Baptist laywoman . As the years passed , Broaddus became a junior college , then a senior college , and Alderson Academy added junior college status . Financial hardship in the late 1920 's led to a decision to merge the two colleges , which shared common missions and outlooks as Baptist and liberal arts institutions . Since its founding , Alderson - Broaddus has been committed to a strong liberal arts education . As such , the College seeks to imbue students with an appreciation of literature and the arts , Christian faith , music and the sciences . In more recent times , the College has focused on developing programs in the natural and applied sciences as well . In 1945 , Alderson - Broaddus developed the first four - year nursing and the first radiologic technology programs in West Virginia . A portion of the physical assets of Storer College , a historically black , Baptist college ( founded 1867 ) in Harpers Ferry , WV , were transferred to Alderson - Broaddus in 1964 and became the “Storer Scholarship” given annually to African - American students . In 1968 , the College pioneered the nation 's first four - year physician assistant program , an innovation that has had significant influence on the development of the physician assistant profession nationwide . From this program emerged in 1991 the College 's first graduate degree offering , the Physician Assistant Master 's program . A - B remains a health - related and professional educational institution firmly rooted in the liberal arts which continues to maintain its long
