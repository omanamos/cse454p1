The Coliseum at Richfield was an arena formerly located in Richfield Township in Summit County , Ohio , roughly halfway between Cleveland and Akron . It was home to the NBA 's Cleveland Cavaliers , WHA 's Cleveland Crusaders , NHL 's Cleveland Barons , MISL 's Cleveland Force , NPSL 's Cleveland Crunch , the IHL 's Cleveland Lumberjacks , and the AFL 's Cleveland Thunderbolts . It hosted the 1981 NBA All - Star Game and WWF 's Survivor Series 1987 , Survivor Series 1988 , and Survivor Series 1992 . The arena , which opened in 1974 , replaced the then - decrepit Cleveland Arena . The new arena seated 20,000 for basketball and 18,500 for hockey , and was one of the first indoor arenas to contain luxury boxes . It also hosted many concerts , with its first event being a concert by Frank Sinatra . Though a fairly large arena at the time of construction , it had only one concourse for both levels , which became overcrowded during games at which the attendance was anywhere close to capacity . The coliseum was built in Richfield to draw fans from both of Northeast Ohio 's major cities , as nearly 5 million Ohioans lived within less than an hour 's drive ( in good weather ) from the Coliseum . However the distance from both population centers proved to be problematic over the years , especially in winter , when traveling the country roads of Richfield was particularly difficult . The arena 's remote location turned out to be one of its biggest flaws . Once plans for Gund Arena ( now Quicken Loans Arena ) in downtown Cleveland were announced in 1991 , the Coliseum became obsolete . After lying vacant for five years , the arena was torn down in 1999 , and the arena and surrounding parking areas were allowed to be returned to woodland - which worked quite well given that the arena had been built off Interstate 271 , which cuts through Cuyahoga Valley National Park .
