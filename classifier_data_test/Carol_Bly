Carol Bly ( b April 16 , 1930 in Duluth , Minnesota as Carol McLean ) is a teacher and an award - winning American author of short stories and essays , as well as nonfiction works on writing . Her work often features Minnesota women who must identify the moral crisis that is facing their community or themselves and enact change through empathy , or opening one 's eyes to the realities of the situation . Bly is the mother of Mary Bly , who writes best - selling romance novels as Eloisa James . The youngest of four children , and the only female , Carol McLean was born in Duluth , Minnesota and was exposed to literatue from a very young age . Her uncle was a personal friend of F. Scott Fitzgerald , and her own neighbor was Sinclair Lewis . Because her mother suffered from tuberculosis and spent much time away from the family being treated in sanitariums , Bly was sent to live with two of her aunts in rural North Carolina for ten years . Although Bly thought her aunts were incredibly mean to her , they also did their part to encourage her to love stories and the characters she found in books . Bly 's mother died in 1942 , at a time when two of her older brothers were also fighting in World War II . As a young teen , Bly worried for the safety of her family and often had nightmares about the Gestapo . Although her family dismissed her fears , telling her that dreams are n't real , Bly never lost her preoccupation with the damage that evil people could do . After graduating from the Abbot Academy boarding school Bly received her B.A. in English and history from Wellesley College in 1951 and spent several years working in New York and Boston before undertaking graduate - level work at the University of Minnesota in 1954 and 1955 . While at Wellesley , Bly met Robert Bly , a future author and poet , on a blind date .

The family lived a relatively simple life , and as she once told a disbelieving census taker , instead of owning a television they entertained themselves with their five thousand plus books . Their house was usually filled with visiting poets , including Donald Hall , James Wright , and Bill Holm , all of whom were asked to do their share of chores before Bly would feed them . The couple had four children , Micah , Bridget , Noah , and Mary , who is now an English professor at Fordham University and a best - selling romance novelist under the pseudonym Eloisa James . While her children were small , Bly worked in the fields when necessary and somehow found time to manage the literary journals published by her husband and William Duffy , Fifties and Sixties , as well as managing their business , the Sixties and the Seventies Press . At the beginning of the next decade , Bly was asked to write a monthly column , " A Letter from the Country " for the Minnesota Public Radio Magazine .
