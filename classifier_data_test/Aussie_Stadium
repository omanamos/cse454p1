Aussie Stadium ( Formerly known as the Sydney Football Stadium , or SFS ) was built in 1988 to be the premium " rectangular field " in Sydney , Australia . Its primary use was for rugby league football ( hence SFS ) , but association football and rugby union also used the ground for major matches , and later for domestic competition . Prior to its construction , major events were usually held at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) , which being an Oval field was not ideal for the sports . The SFS was built in Moore Park , adjacent to the SCG , on the grounds of the former Sydney Sportsground and is owned by the SCG Trust . Its seating capacity was 41,159 , but today stands at 45,500 , although the venue 's official record attendance for a sporting event stands at 43,967 , for the 1993 FIFA World Cup Qualifier when Australia played Argentina . In 2002 the SFS was renamed Aussie Stadium - in a 5 Year + 5 Year naming rights deal with the business Aussie Home Loans . In 2003 , the Aussie Stadium hosted several matches in the Rugby World Cup ; Ireland v Namibia , Argentina v Romania , Scotland v Fiji , South Africa v Georgia and Georgia v Uruguay . The final match was notable for attracting a crowd of 28,576 , despite the low profiles of both teams . Aussie Stadium usually hosts both NRL semi finals and one preliminary final , and also held the annual pre - season Charity Shield rugby league match between South Sydney and St George Illawarra for a number of years . Rugby League Grand Finals have been played there in the past . Most major representative rugby football matches in Sydney that were once played at the SFS , such as State of Origin rugby league and rugby union Internationals , have been played at Telstra Stadium ( Stadium Australia ) since it was finished in 1999 for the 2000 Olympic Games . This much larger new stadium took a lot of the major events away from the SFS , leaving it as a second - tier venue although it is far from a white elephant . The ground also hosted many memorable semi - finals and Monday Night Football in 1996 . Rugby union provided a moment of magic thanks to George Gregan 's last second match - winning tackle on NZ 's Jeff Wilson in which Australia regained the Bledisloe Cup in 1994 . Argentinian superstar footballer Diego Maradona played here for the 1993 World Cup qualifier against Australia in which the match was drawn 1 - 1 . Aussie Stadium hosted the boxing fight between Danny Green and Anthony Mundine on 17 May 2006 . The inaugural A - League Grand Final was held here on March 5 2006 . The stadium hosted the 2006 Rugby League Tri - Nations Grand Final on 25 November . Aussie Stadium is currently under renovations to expand capacity to 45,500 and add a second video screen . Renovations are expected to be complete in early 2007 . Australia versus Kuwait playing at Aussie Stadium .
