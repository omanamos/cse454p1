Bulldog Stadium is a stadium in Fresno , California , USA . It is primarily used for American football , and is the home field of the Fresno State Bulldogs . The stadium opened in 1980 and holds 41,031 people . One of the most complete and aesthetically pleasing stadiums in the Western Athletic Conference , Bulldog Stadium has served as the home of Fresno State football since the 1980 season . Entering its 26th season of hosting the Bulldogs , the facility has established itself as one of the most difficult places for a visiting team to win . Fresno State has gone 130 - 32 - 2 at Bulldog Stadium since 1980 , for a winning percentage of over 80 percent . Even more impressive is the success of the team since 1999 , during which time the Bulldogs have gone 43 - 8 . Included in that record are victories over Oregon State ( twice ) , Colorado State and California . Since Pat Hill took over as head coach in 1997 , Fresno State is 51 - 11 ( .823 ) at home . Much of that success stems from an environment considered the noisiest in the Western Athletic Conference . With a capacity of 41,031 , the stadium has been filled at near 100 percent capacity ever since record crowds began to pour into the facility in 2001 . No other conference team has experienced this consistently high attendance . Featuring a natural grass playing surface and a tree - lined concourse , Bulldog Stadium underwent a two - phase expansion project in 1991 which included the addition of more than 10,000 seats - - increasing the stadium 's capacity from 30,000 to 41,031 - - and the construction of 22 sky suites . Additional restrooms and concession facilities were also constructed . The first phase entailed filling in the panels beyond the north and south end zones with bench seating and the reconfiguration of seating on the stadium 's east side . The second phase , completed prior to the 1892 season , featured the addition of 22 sky suites , each of which includes seating for 20 , among other amenities . The stadium expansion was a result of the overwhelming fan support the Bulldogs have enjoyed since the early 1980s . In the years just prior to expansion , Fresno State played before crowds well in excess of the official 30,000 - seat capacity in 36 of 37 possible home dates . In 1993 , one year after expansion was completed , the Bulldogs averaged 39,536 fans during their six home dates . Original construction of Bulldog Stadium began in June of 1979 following what was then the most successful capital fundraising project ever undertaken in the San Joaquin Valley . Local residents raised in excess of $7 million for the project . No state tax dollars or student fees were used to build the stadium . Built partially below ground level with the playing field 37 feet below grade , the bowl has a low profile appearance . A unique cantilevered lighting system extends toward the field and is directed downward to concentrate lighting on the playing surface . Chair seating for more than 5,000 spectators is located on the west side of the stadium between the 18 - yard lines to accommodate contributors of the $7 million . The remaining seating , with the exception of the recent addition of 3,240 chairback seats on the east side , is on aluminum benches . The construction of a new video board
