Axia College was first established under Western International University ( WIU , a sister school to the University of Phoenix , both institutions operate under the Apollo Group ) . Due to the massive influx of students registering and the amount of potential students to register , the decision was made to have Axia College of WIU officially moved to be under the University of Phoenix . This transition took place over the April 1st - 2nd , 2006 weekend , with the first Axia of UOP students starting on April 3rd , 2006 . Axia College of the University of Phoenix is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools .
