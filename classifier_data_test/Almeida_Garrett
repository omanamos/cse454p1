João Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett , 1st Viscount de Almeida Garrett , pron . IPA : , ( Porto , February 4 , 1799 – December 9 , 1854 ) was a Portuguese Romanticist poet , novelist , dramatist , and Liberal politician . João Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett was born João Leitão da Silva in Oporto as the son of António Bernardo da Silva Garrett and wife Ana Augusta de Almeida Leitão . He early changed his name to João Baptista da Silva Leitão , adding a name from his godfather and altering the order of his surnames . In 1809 he fled the second French invasion ( see Peninsular War ) carried out by Soult’s troops , seeking refuge in Angra do Heroísmo , Terceira Island , Azores . While in the Azores , he was taught by his uncle , Dom Frei Alexandre da Sagrada Família , then the Bishop of Angra . In 1818 , he moved to Coimbra to study at the local University 's law school . In 1818 , he published O Retrato de Venus , a work for which was soon to be prosecuted , as it was considered " materialist , atheist , and immoral " ; it was during this period that he adopted his pen name Almeida Garrett . Although he did not take active part in the Liberal Revolution that broke out in Oporto in 1820 , he contributed with two patriotic verses , the Hymno Constitucional and the Hymno Patriótico , which his friends copied and distributed in the streets of Oporto . After the " Vilafrancada " , a reactionary coup d’etat led by the Infante D. Miguel in 1823 , he was forced to seek exile in England . He had just married the beautiful Luísa Midosi who was only 12 or 13 years old at the time . While in England , in Edgbaston , Warwickshire , he began his association with Romanticism , being subject to the first - hand influences of William Shakespeare and Walter Scott , as well as to that of Gothic aesthetics . In the beginning of 1825 , Garrett left for France where he wrote Camões ( 1825 ) and Dona Branca ( 1826 ) – both poems are usually considered the first Romanticist works in Portuguese literature . In 1826 , he returned to Portugal , where he settled for two years and founded the newspapers O Portuguez and O Chronista . Almeida Garrett , together with Alexandre Herculano and Joaquim António de Aguiar , took part in the Landing of Mindelo , carried out during the Liberal Wars . When a constitutional monarchy was established , he briefly served as its Consul General to Brussels ; upon his return , he was acclaimed as one of the major orators of Liberalism , and took innitiative in the creation of a new Portuguese theatre ( during the period , he wrote his historical plays Gil Vicente , D. Filipa de Vilhena , and O Alfageme de Santarém ) . In 1843 , Garrett published Romanceiro e Cancioneiro Geral , a collection of folklore ; two years later , he wrote the first volume of his historical novel O Arco de Santana ( fully published in 1850 , it took inspiration from Victor Hugo 's The Hunchback of Notre Dame ) . O Arco de Santana signified a change in Garrett 's style , leading to a more complex and subjective prose with which he experimented at length in ( ( Travels
