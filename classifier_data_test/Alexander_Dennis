Alexander Dennis Limited ( formerly known as TransBus International ) is the largest bus builder in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world . Alexander Dennis was formed as Transbus on 1 January 2001 , after the merger of Mayflower Corporation - owned Walter Alexander Coachbuilders and Dennis Chassis , and Henlys owned - Plaxton , all based in the United Kingdom . A KMB 's Enviro 500 in Hong Kong . Transbus had a variety of factories around the United Kingdom from all three merged companies : the former Alexander factories at Falkirk , Scotland and Belfast , Northern Ireland , the former Plaxton factories at Anston and Scarborough , the former Northern Counties factory at Wigan , and the Dennis factory at Guildford . At the height of Transbus , the company produced a range of both bus & coach chassis and bodies as well as fire engines and waste collection vehicles . Included among its range of chassis were the Dennis Dart , one of the all time best selling buses in the UK , and the Dennis Trident . Transbus also produced export variants for service in New York City , Hong Kong , and other locations . The Dennis Trident is the most common bus model in service in London . Since the creation of Transbus merged both Plaxton and Alexander , the Transbus range included Plaxton coaches as well as two double decker bodies ( the Plaxton President and the Alexander ALX400 ) , the Alexander ALX300 citybus and the Pointer body built in quantity on the aforementioned Dennis Dart chassis , which replaced the Alexander ALX200 body built previously on a Dart chassis . On 31 March 2004 , the Mayflower Group was put into administration and by default Transbus also entered administration . On 17 May 2004 , the Plaxton coach business was sold to its management and returned to its separate Plaxton identity ( Transbus had been in the process of eradicating the traditional company names from the vehicles ) . Four days later , on 21 May 2004 , the remaining part of Transbus ( Alexander and Dennis ) was bought by independent business men ( one of whom was Brian Souter , owner of the Stagecoach Group , although the acquisition was kept separate from the bus and train operation ) . The new company became Alexander Dennis . The sale did not include the former Alexander Belfast plant , which later closed down . On 26 January 2005 , Alexander Dennis 's Wigan plant was closed after finishing the orders of its President body . Alexander Dennis reported a pre - tax loss of £6.6m on a turnover of £195m for the 17 month period to 30 September 2005 , including £5.7m of exceptional items in the five month " restructuring period " from administration . Excluding the restructuring period , a pre - tax profit of £7m was recorded on a turnover of £150m in the 12 month period to 30 September 2005 . Since the administration period and restructuring of the former Transbus International , ADL has secured a number of major orders from UK operators , and is the favoured manufacturer of the Stagecoach Group . The company has also continued to find success in its predecessors ' traditional markets of Hong Kong and the Republic of Ireland , with the Enviro 500 securing orders in both markets , and the ALX400 double - deck body remaining the Dublin Bus standard vehicle .
