Algoma Steel Corporation ( TSX : AGA ) was founded in 1902 by Francis Clergue , an American entrepreneur who had settled in Sault Ste . Algoma Steel is an integrated primary steel producer located at the hub of the Great Lakes in Sault Ste . Algoma products are sold in Canada and the United States as well as overseas . The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004 . In April 2007 , Algoma Steel was purchased by India 's Essar Group for US$ 1.63 billion . On February 18 , 1902 the first Bessemer converter was put in operation using pig iron made from the Helen mine , owned by Algoma . The first rails were produced by the complex in May 1902 . However , blast furnaces for pig iron manufacture were not completed at the site until 1906 . Unlike most other steel producers , Algoma had no access to local coal , forcing it to import coal and coke from the United States . The Bessemer process was felt to produce steel that was well - suited to manufacture of rails , which was the Algoma complex primary product for the first two decades of its existence . Algoma Steel from North Ste . Shortly after founding Algoma , Clergue 's various financial operations suffered reverses and he lost control of the Sault St. Marie complex , being replaced as general manager in 1903 and by 1908 was no longer on the company 's board of directors . Initially the company specialized in manufacture of rails for Canadian railways , but this soon became a dead - end as railway construction passed its peak . During the First World War Algoma made steel for artillery shells but after the war continued to rely on rail production . Low quality of Canadian iron ore and the necessity to import ore and coal from the United States , as well as absentee owners more interested in annual dividends than building a viable industrial complex , held back Algoma during the 1920s . At the height of the Great Depression , the company was insolvent and in receivership until Sir James Dunn gained control in 1935 and restored it to profitability . Dunn 's policy of never paying a dividend to stockholders , coupled with extensive modernization and expansion during the Second World War , and an extended period of steel controls up until the mid 1950 's , allowed Algoma to expand and become a more balanced steel producer . From 1988 to 1991 Algoma was owned by Dofasco , making the combined company the largest steel producer in Canada . However , a strike at Algoma and other Dofasco subsidiaries in 1990 caused Dofasco to abandon ownership . Algoma Steel from Wallace Terr. , Sault Ste .
