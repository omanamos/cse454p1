ASDA is a chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom offering food , clothing and general merchandise products . It became a subsidiary of the American retail giant Wal - Mart in 1999 , and is currently the second largest chain in the UK after Tesco . ASDA is Wal - Mart 's largest overseas subsidiary , accounting for almost half of the company 's international sales . As of January 2006 , there were 21 ASDA / Wal - Mart Supercentres , 243 ASDA superstores , 37 ASDA supermarkets ( including town centres ) , five ASDA Living stores , 10 George clothing stores and 24 depots ( distribution centres ) . ASDA has 150,000 employees , who it refers to as " colleagues " ( 90,000 part - time , 60,000 full - time ) . The company is also engaged in property development through its subsidiary company , Gazeley Properties Limited . As a wholly owned division of Wal - Mart , ASDA is not required to declare quarterly or half - yearly earnings . It submits full accounts to Companies House each October . The present ASDA Stores Limited was founded by Laura Beth Murray as Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Ltd in 1949 . However the formation of the ASDA name occurred in 1965 with the merger of the Asquith chain of three supermarkets and Associated Dairies ; ASDA is an abbreviation of ASquith and DAiries . For a short time in the 1980s Asda Stores Ltd was a subsidiary of ASDA - MFI plc following a merger between the two companies . Other companies in the group were Associated Dairies Ltd , the furniture retailer MFI and Allied Carpets . After the sale of MFI and Allied Carpets the company name changed to ASDA Group plc . The dairy division was sold to Northern Foods plc , meaning that ASDA today has no connection with the firm its name was derived from . The company went through a troubled period in the early 1990s , but was then revived under the leadership of Archie Norman , who later became a front bench Conservative MP. He was chairman of the company during the period 1996â€“99 . ASDA , which then owned 229 stores , was purchased by Wal - Mart of the United States , on July 26 , 1999 . Since the takeover ASDA has continued to maintain its headquarters at the then newly opened " ASDA House " . ASDA House was one of the first of the new large office blocks to open as part of the redevelopment of the huge area south of the River Aire from the city centre of Leeds , in the Holbeck district , West Yorkshire . In 2005 , amid reported concerns within Wal - Mart about a slight slippage in market share , partially due to a resurgent Sainsbury 's , ASDA 's chief executive , Tony de Nunzio , was replaced by Andy Bond . In the same year , Asda expanded into Northern Ireland by purchasing 12 Safeway stores from Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc . Following the takeover by Wal - Mart , several " Asda Wal - Mart Supercentres " have been opened , creating some of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom . The first of these stores opened at Patchway , near Bristol , in August 2000 . At first , it was criticised for its scale and condemned as an eyesore . In November 2004 a refurbishment of the hypermarket was completed , addressing some of the complaints
