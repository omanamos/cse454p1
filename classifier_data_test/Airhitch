Airhitch is a user - run system for hitchhiking on commercial airliners . It was started by a group of U.S. college students in the 1960s . People who travel in this way generally refer to themselves as Airhitchers . Most airhitchers fly between the United States and Western Europe . Before Airhitch migrated to internet based communication in the 1990s , it operated out of North American offices including New York , Los Angeles ( Santa Monica ) , San Francisco , Seattle , Montr√©al , and Vancouver , and numerous European cities including Paris , Amsterdam , Berlin , Bonn , and Rome . Airhitch is a non - commercial system / method / process . Today virtually all exchange of Airhitch information takes place in an AIM chat room . In the chat room Airhitchers use their real names , while the staff use screen names such as Airhitch01 , and Airhitch08 . Since 2006 the cost and availability of " Airhitchable " flights has been questionable . Currently the majority of " AHers " opt to help each other find conventional airfare to their destinations . Airhitchers formally commit to participation in the Airhitch system by sending an online registration to the staff . With the guidance of the staff , Airhitchers explore the best possibilities for catching rides on flights and the procedural mechanics of how to take advantage of them . Airhitchers decide which flight they will attempt to board . Airhitchers go to the airport and attempt to board the aircraft .
