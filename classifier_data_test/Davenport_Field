Davenport Field is a baseball stadium in Charlottesville , Virginia . It is the home field of the University of Virginia Cavaliers college baseball teams . The stadium holds 2,924 fans and opened in 2002 . It is named after former UVA executive director , Ted Davenport . On February 16 , 2002 the University of Virginia baseball program defeated the Bucknell Bison by the score of 10 - 3 in the first ever contest played at the brand new UVa Baseball Stadium . Virginia opened the door on its new multi - million dollar facility for the 2002 season . The UVa Baseball Stadium has been through a series of improvements over its tenure as the home to the Virginia Cavaliers , but none like the recent upgrades and renovations that have taken place in recent years . Improvements to the stadium include : a canopied grandstand with 1,500 seats ; an additional 500 seats and a grass hillside to provide more seating ; six sky boxes for lease by fans and corporate sponsors ; stadium lights ; new dugouts for the home and visiting teams ; an on - site locker room and club house ; a new press box , and a new concession area . Representing a major athletic facility improvement , the University of Virginia installed a new grass playing surface at the then UVa Baseball Field in 1998 . The Bermuda grass playing surface - known as Davenport Field - was dedicated on Saturday , April 13th , 2002 during Virginia 's second contest of a three - game series against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons . Following the 2005 season , the left field wall was shortened and moved inward to decrease the distance down the line by 17 feet . The right field was not adjusted as the stadium dimensions became asymmetrical for 2006 . Following the 2006 season , a new scoreboard featuring a video system similar to the ones at the John Paul Jones Arena and Klockner Stadium was installed at Davenport Field . The right field wall was adjusted in association with the project , resulting in a return to symmetrical field dimensions for 2007 . The new ballpark has enabled Virginia to schedule games against nationally prominent teams that previously would have been played on the road . In addition , the facility will become a community asset , offering a potential venue for high school tournaments and adult - league games. " . The field was named in honor of Thomas " Ted " Edward Davenport who served the University of Virginia as Executive Director and Secretary / Treasurer of the Virginia Student Aid Foundation ( VSAF ) from 1958 until 1988 . He was a dear friend and avid fan of the University until his death in 2001 . A 1953 graduate of the Curry School of Education , Davenport was instrumental in increasing the donations and donors to the annual fund and leading capital funding efforts for the athletics program during his tenure .
