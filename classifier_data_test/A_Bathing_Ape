A Bathing Ape , or Bape , is a Japanese clothing company specializing in urban clothes . The company produces a variety of clothing items , including but not limited to : T - shirts , polos , sweatshirts , hoodies , parkas , jackets , denim , and most notably , the " Bape Sta " , a shoe very closely resembling the Nike Air Force One . At the moment there are roughly 33 stores across Tokyo , Hong Kong , China , Taiwan , London , and New York . Bape clothing is worn by famous rappers including Kanye West , Jin Auyeung , Lil ' Wayne , Jay - Z , Massari and Pharrell . A Bathing Ape was started in 1993 by DJ Nigo . He started selling t - shirts out of a small store in Harajuku , Japan called Nowhere Inc . As the company grew , he opened more stores . Pharrell also helped Nigo in producing Bape adding this collection to the Billionaire Boys Club and now a line owned and created by Pharrell called Ice Cream Footwear.In 2007 , Kanye West collaborated with A Bathing Ape to make his own shoe . Also because of the exclusivity of these shoes ( being that roughly less than 1000 pairs of each shoe colorway are made ) many fake pairs are made and sold online . The only places to buy A Bathing Ape or BAPE items are the official BAPE stores which are located in New York , London , Hong Kong and various stores in Japan . A Bathing Ape products are also available online via unoffical resellers on eBay and a small amount of websites . 1 No. 9 Alley 35 Lane 181 Sec. 4 Jhongsaio E. Rd . Because Bathing Ape fetches such a high price there is large amount of fake bape ( Often called ' Fape ' ) that is avaiable in some stores ( which usually carry other fake clothing ) , eBay and websites . It is such a problem that in the offical Bape Catalogue there is a full page giving a warning about Fake Bape products . Fake Bape prices are usually around $80 for hoodies ( Real Bape can start at $200 to $600 , sometimes more , note : expensive does not mean real , and cheap does not mean fake as bapes are acknowledged to be an expensive brand however they retail in japan for only about 20,000 yen . There are no offical retailers on eBay , but there is a small amount of unoffical websites and a small amount of eBay sellers that sell real Bape products .
