The Art Hauser Centre is a multi - purpose arena in Prince Albert , Saskatchewan , Canada . It was built in 1971 and is home to the Prince Albert Raiders Ice hockey team in the Western Hockey League . Its hockey capacity is 2,591 seated , plus 708 standing . The Art Hauser Centre was formerly known as the Prince Albert Communiplex , but it was renamed late in the 2004 - 2005 hockey season as part of the " Bring Back The Magic " campaign . This was an endeavour to raise money for extensive renovations to the Communiplex . In just under a month , the campaign raised over $3 million . The arena was named in honour of Art Hauser who made a donation of $1,000,000 to the campaign . Renovations were completed in the spring of 2006 .
