He has also written a novel , Voice of the Fire , and performs " workings " ( one - off performance art / spoken word pieces ) with the Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels , some of which have been released on CD . As a comics writer , Moore is notable for applying literary and formalist sensibilities to the medium . As well as including challenging subject matter and adult themes , he brings a wide range of influences to his work , from the literary – authors such as William S. Burroughs , Thomas Pynchon and Iain Sinclair , New Wave science fiction writers like Michael Moorcock and horror writers like Clive Barker – to the cinematic – filmmakers like Nicolas Roeg . Influences within comics include Will Eisner , Harvey Kurtzman , Jack Kirby and Bryan Talbot . Moore was born in November 18 , 1953 , in Northampton , England to brewery worker Ernest Moore and printer Sylvia Doreen . He was influenced by his highly religious and superstitious grandmother . He lived in a very poor area , and was expelled from school aged 17 for dealing in LSD . After this he tried to become an artist for comics , before moving on to writing . With his first wife , Phyllis , he had two daughters , Amber and Leah . The couple also had a mutual lover , Deborah Delano . After Moore had received widespread commerical success for his comic - writing , he decided to turn his back on the money orientated world of mainstream comics to develop more ambitious projects . Together , with his wife and their lover , the three of them set up their own comic books company , " Mad Love Publishing " , in 1989 . Unfortunately things did not go to plan ; Mad Love Publishing suffered several unforeseeable setbacks , and Phyllis and Deborah left Moore to live together , with his two children . After the failure of his relationships and publishing company , Moore was forced to return to mainstream comic writing , but refused to return to either DC or Marvel . It did not take long for Moore to find commercial and critical success again , and by 1998 Moore was planning an entire comic books line , later known as America 's Best Comics , with which he would write five complete series entirely by himself . In March 2006 Moore completed his self - penned comics books line , and once again announced his decision to return to less commercially orientated works . Also in 2006 , he appeared on the BBC 's The Culture Show and joined a campaign to try and save Northampton council housing from being sold to private companies . On May 12 , 2007 , he married Melinda Gebbie , with whom he has worked on several comics . He currently lives in Northampton . He is a vegetarian , an anarchist , a practising magician , and worships a Roman snake - deity named Glycon . Cover art for the collected edition of V for Vendetta by David Lloyd . After dropping out of school , Moore spent the next several years in menial jobs before embarking on a career as a cartoonist in the late 1970s .
