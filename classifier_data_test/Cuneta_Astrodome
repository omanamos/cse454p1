Cuneta Astrodome is an indoor sporting arena located in Pasay City , Philippines . It is better known as the home of the Philippine Basketball Association from 1993 , when it left the Philsports Arena , then known as the ULTRA , until 1998 . It also host to other basketball leagues and political and evangelical gatherings . Built in 1993 , the arena hosted a number of Philippine Basketball Association games full - time until 1998 . During the first two years , the league played all of its games ( except those played in provinces ) at the Astrodome before limiting its schedule to Tuesday and Sunday games , as the league played its Friday games at the Araneta Coliseum ( aka " The Big Dome " ) . In 1999 , the league decided to hold most of its games at the Big Dome and at the PhilSports Arena , its previous home for many years . Although the league hosted a few games at the said venue , it was not used for the duration of the 2000 season . Since 2001 , the league has host a decent amount of games at the Astrodome , including several recent PBA championship series games . It has hosted 27 PBA championship series ( as of the 2006 - 07 PBA Philippine Cup Finals ) , most of them in a championship clinching series .

In 2005 , the NCAA held majority of its games at the Astrodome while the UAAP played a series of games in the 2004 season .

It also hosted the Philippine Basketball League during the mid - 90 's and during the 2005 PBL Unity Cup Finals between the champion Welcoat Paintmasters and the Montana Jewels .
