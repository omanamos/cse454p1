The Azadi Stadium ( Persian : استاديوم آزادی ) is Iran 's national and largest stadium . The Azadi stadium officially has a capacity of 90,000 people and was built to host the 1974 Asian Games . The stadium is part of the much larger Azadi Sports Complex , and is surrounded by a number of grass pitches , built for training . Azadi Stadium is where most of Iran 's national games , and sensitive matches of Iran 's Premier League , are held . In 2002 , the lower level of the stadium had seats installed , the pitch was replanted along with an underground heating system and a big screen television was added on . Stadium management also plans to later install seats in the upper level of the stadium . The renovations were completed in 2003 , reducing the capacity of the stadium to 90,000 as the lower level of the stadium was refurnished with 35,000 seats . Despite its reduced capacity , Azadi Stadium has been filled over capacity at times such as the Iran - Japan World Cup 2006 qualification match in March 2005 . In 2004 a large jumbotron television was added , replacing the original scoreboard . This giant screen with a total area of about 300 square meters and screen area of 104 square meters ( 20m in 7.5m ) is one of the biggest in the world . The stadium was once called the Aryamehr Stadium in honor of the former Shah of Iran but then changed to Azadi Stadium after the Iranian Revolution.The stadium is located in the West of Tehran , and is easily accessible for most people living in the city . Opposing teams often find it difficult to play their best game , when the stadium is full , as the noise level becomes very high .
