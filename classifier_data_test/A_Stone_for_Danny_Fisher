A Stone For Danny Fisher is a very serious , early novel by Harold Robbins that looks at the effect of the Great Depression on a lower - middle class Jewish family . Written in 1952 it is actually set in the period up to 1944 . The novel opens in the mid - 1920 's as a young Danny Fisher and his family move in to a new house in the Brooklyn suburbs . Within a few years , however , the Depression hits and Danny is forced to use his one talent , boxing , as a means of supporting his family . A few years further on , the family have lost their house and are living in a mean apartment in the City . Danny continues to box , much against his father 's wish , and dates a young Italian Catholic girl - much to the chagrin of his mother 's Jewishness . Danny 's boxing skills attract the attention of the local hoodlums and he is offered a large sum of money to throw the ' Golden Gloves ' championship - a fight he could win easily and would bring him professional fame as well as , it is hoped , his father 's acceptance . Danny accepts the bribe but beats his opponent . After going on the run for a few years in Coney Island , he returns to marry his Italian sweetheart but their early married life is marred by the death of their first born child in poverty . At this point , Danny seeks out his former manager and goes into business with him as a black marketeer - an event which surely brings him in to contact with the very hoods he ripped off previously . The conclusion to the story , with Danny 's gory machine - gun death in counterpoint to arrival of new life , is inevitable . The novel was adapted as the movie King Creole for a young Elvis Presley , but retained very little of the original plot .
