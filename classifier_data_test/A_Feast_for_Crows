A Feast for Crows is the fourth of seven planned novels in A Song of Ice and Fire , an epic fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin . The novel was first published on October 17 2005 in the United Kingdom , with a United States edition following on November 8 2005 ; however , it appeared ahead of the publication date in several UK bookshops . Its publication was preceded by a novella named Arms of the Kraken , which collected the first four Iron Islands chapters together . Arms of the Kraken was published in the August 2002 edition of Dragon Magazine . Another chapbook featuring three Daenerys chapters was published for BookExpo 2005 , although these chapters were subsequently moved into the fifth volume , A Dance with Dragons . Like its predecessor A Storm of Swords , A Feast for Crows was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel , one of the two most prestigious awards in science fiction and fantasy publishing , although it lost out the 2006 ballot to Robert Charles Wilson 's Spin . A Feast for Crows was also the first novel in the sequence to debut at the top of the New York Times bestseller list , a feat among fantasy writers only previously achieved by David Eddings , Robert Jordan and Neil Gaiman . Due to complexities that arose during the writing process , A Feast for Crows only includes some of the POV characters from the past novels , as well as some new characters who appear only briefly . The remaining characters will return in A Dance with Dragons , the fifth book . A Feast for Crows is set in a fictitious world reminiscent of Medieval Europe ( primarily on a continent called Westeros ) , except for the fact that in this world , seasons can last for years , occasionally decades . A Feast for Crows picks up the tale where A Storm of Swords left off and runs simultaneously with events in the following novel , A Dance with Dragons . The War of the Five Kings seems to be winding down . Robb Stark , Joffrey Baratheon , Renly Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy are dead . King Stannis Baratheon has gone to the aid of the Wall , where Jon Snow has become Lord Commander . King Tommen Baratheon , Joffrey 's eight - year - old brother , now rules in King 's Landing under the watchful eye of his mother , the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister . Lord Tywin Lannister is dead , murdered by his son Tyrion in his flight from the city . Sansa Stark is in hiding in the Vale , protected by Petyr ' Littlefinger ' Baelish who has murdered his wife Lysa Arryn and named himself Protector of the Vale and guardian of eight - year - old Lord Robert Arryn . The novel spans several months in the first half of the year 300 After the Landing , possibly longer . In the city of Oldtown , a young novice of the Citadel named Pate steals a master key from one of the maesters and sells it to a mysterious man calling himself the Alchemist . Shortly after receiving his payment , Pate collapses in the street . In the city of King 's Landing , the funeral of Tywin Lannister is held .
