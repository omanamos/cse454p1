A History of Vodka ( Russian : История водки , Romanized : Istoriya vodki ) is a scholarly monograph by the kandidat of historical sciences William Pokhlyobkin , awarded the Langhe Ceretto Prize . Regarding the Soviet - Polish dispute on vodka in the late 70s and being finished in 1979 , the work however was published just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union . Apart from his successful attempt to provide a rationale of the Soviet opinion , Pokhlyobkin wanted the Russian vodka to be legally produced only from the rye stuff . Around 1977 , a dispute arose between the People 's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union over priority of vodka production between two states . Polish state vodka monopoly held the opinion that within the borders of the Kingdom of Poland , the First Rzeczpospolita and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania vodka was known prior to Muscovy and the Russian Empire . The Soviet response was maintained by the Ministry of Foreign Commerce and , particularly , Soyuzplodimport . The last one requested a peer review in the History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Institute and the Fermentation Products Institute of Glavspirt ( Ministry of Food Industry ) . Both institutes turned down the request while Poland became unable to prove the statement that the local vodka ( gorzałka ) was created prior to the middle of the 16th century . After years of painstaking research Pokhlyobkin concluded that Russia 's first grain - based vodka could be distilled at the premises of one of the Muscovite monasteries and , apparently , in the city of Moscow itself in 1440s . Pokhlyobkin suggests that both prohibition and drunkenness are scourges which encourage one another . He considers the vodka itself does n't make people drunk , but only irresponsible and uncultured ways of consuming it . The later Russian editions include the 2005 softcover issue by Tsentrpoligraf ( ISBN 5 - 9524 - 1895 - 3 ) . Three years after release the book was examined by David Christian in Slavic Review and the phony statistics , anti - capitalist polemics and Stalinist snobberies have been outlined . The definitions of such terms as distilling and state monopoly were found so vague that it became hard to know when Pokhlyobkin offered firm dates for their first appearance . Meanwhile , the arguments about the first usage of the word " vodka " and its first appearance were marked as convoluted , messy , repetitive , sometimes self - contradictory and unconvincing . Another case , tackled by criticism is the way On the Combinations of Water with Alcohol by Dmitriy Mendeleyev was emphasized . It was pointed out that Pokhlyobkin used Mendeleyev 's data in a speculative way to ascribe to solution of spirit and water the eminent " biochemical and physiological properties " . Вторая половина XVII — первая половина XVIII века . Винокуренное производство ( Essays On History of the Russian trade . The 2nd Half of the 17th - 1st Half of the 18th Century . The Distilling ) by Volkov , and the inquiry on history of the vodka production ) helped the Soviet claim .
