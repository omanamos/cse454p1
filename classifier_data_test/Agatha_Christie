Agatha Mary Clarissa , Lady Mallowan , DBE ( 15 September 1890 â€” 12 January 1976 ) , also known as Dame Agatha Christie , was an English crime fiction writer . She also wrote romances under the name Mary Westmacott , but is chiefly remembered for her 66 detective novels . Her work with these novels , particularly featuring detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple , have given her the title the ' Queen of Crime ' and made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre . Christie has been called - by the Guinness Book of World Records , among others - the best - selling writer of books of all time , and the best - selling writer of any kind second to William Shakespeare . An estimated one billion copies of her novels have been sold in English , and another billion in 103 other languages . As an example of her broad appeal , she is the all - time best - selling author in France , with over 40 million copies sold in French ( as of 2003 ) versus 22 million for Emile Zola , the nearest contender . Her stage play The Mousetrap holds the record for the longest run ever in London , opening at the Ambassadors Theatre on 25 November 1952 , and as of 2007 is still running after more than 20,000 performances . In 1955 , Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America 's highest honor , the Grand Master Award , and in the same year , Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA , for Best Play . Most of her books and short stories have been filmed , some many times over ( Murder on the Orient Express , Death on the Nile , 4.50 From Paddington ) , and many have been adapted for television and radio and video games .

The couple had one daughter , Rosalind Hicks , and divorced in 1928 . During World War I she worked at a hospital and then a pharmacy , a job that influenced her work : many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison .
