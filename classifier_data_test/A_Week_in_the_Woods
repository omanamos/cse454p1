A Week in the Woods is a children 's book by Andrew Clements . Part of his School series , it was released by Simon & Schuster in 2002 . The book was critically acclaimed , and nominated for a number of awards . Mark 's parents are wealthy . He is taken care of by a kind Russian couple who act as housekeepers and babysitters . Mark 's life takes an unexpected turn : from New York and an elite private school to small town New Hampshire and a public school . His parents have bought 450 rural acres and expensively renovated an old farmhouse . Mark is sent to live there - by himself with the housekeepers - because there are " tax advantages " to establishing residency . Because Mark does n't expect to be in the local public school more than a few months , he ends up burning bridges rather than making the best of it . And by the time Mark comes to realize that this new home and the wilderness around it are the best things that have ever happened to him , it is far too late to mend those bridges with the kids at school and especially with the ecologically minded teacher Mr Maxwell . The conflict leads to a near disaster on the annual school camping trip : a field trip called " A Week in the Woods " . Simon and Schuster : List of awards won by A Week in the Woods .
