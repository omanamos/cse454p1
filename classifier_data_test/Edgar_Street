Edgar Street is a football stadium in Hereford , England and is the home of Hereford United who currently play in League Two . It is located close to the city centre of Hereford on the road of the same name ( A49 ) . The site has been used as a stadium since the late 19th century although it is unclear exactly when it was built . In its early years it was a multi - purpose stadium used mainly for football and athletics . This is evident by the characteristic curved ends of the stadium which accommodated the athletics track . The stadium was originally owned by the Hereford Athletic Ground Company and was also used by amateur football side Hereford City . In 1924 Hereford United was formed by the amalgamation of two local clubs and began ground - sharing with City while paying rent to the Athletics company . Even in those days Hereford United struggled financially and the landlord obligingly reduced the rent to help the club . In 1931 the stadium was purchased by Hereford City Council for Â£3,000 , and in 1952 United secured a lease on the stadium for the first time . The Merton Stand , before the kickoff against Stockport County on 3 February 2007 , viewed from the Len Weston Stand . The Merton Stand , on the eastern side of the ground is the only all - seater stand and was built in 1968 . Originally it was flanked on either side by standing areas known as the Cowsheds , but the stand was extended to cover the entire length of the pitch in the 1970s . It is the nominated family stand and includes the director 's box and press box , with the dugouts and players ' tunnel located in front of structure . The stand is unusual in that it is built on the club 's main buildings with various windows at pitch level . These include the Vice Presidents ' Club and Legend 's , the supporter 's bar . The Meadow End , located at the northern end of the ground , is a covered terrace and is home to the club 's most vocal supporters . It has a distinctive curve ( see above ) with a flat area in front of the terracing enabling supporters to stand directly behind the perimeter wall of the pitch . It has a capacity of approximately 3,500 . Located behind this end is the substantial Merton Meadow car park . The Len Weston Stand , on the western side of the ground , comprises two tiers and was built in 1974 , replacing the previous wooden grandstand . It is unusual in that the lower tier is terraced and the upper tier seated . The upper tier contains just five rows of seating but offers perhaps the best view in the ground as it is higher up than the Merton Stand . The view from the terracing on the lower tier can be obscured by a number of supporting pillars , but also has the benefit of being close to the pitch . Ticket allocation is split between home and away supporters with the half on the Meadow End side is allocated to Hereford 's supporters . The rebuilt stand was named after the former president and benefactor of the club , Len Weston , of the cider and perry making family business . However it was renamed the " Floors - 2 - Go Stand " for the 2006 - 07 season , with
