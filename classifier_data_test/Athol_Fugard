Harold Athol Lannigan Fugard ( b. June 11 1932 , Middleburg , South Africa ) , better known as Athol Fugard , is a South African playwright . His wife , Sheila Fugard , and their daughter , Lisa Fugard , are also writers . His family moved to Port Elizabeth soon after he was born . In 1938 , he was enrolled at the Marist Brothers College — a Catholic primary school ( although he is not known to be a Roman Catholic ) . After being awarded a scholarship , he enrolled at the local technical college for his secondary education . He then enrolled in the University of Cape Town but dropped out . He sailed around the world working on ships ( mainly in the Far East ) . Fugard married Sheila Meiring , then an actress in one of his plays , in September 1956 . She later became a novelist and poet in her own right . They started the Circle Players in Port Elizabeth before moving to Johannesburg where he was employed as a court clerk . Working in the court environment and seeing how the Africans suffered under the pass laws provided Fugard with a firsthand insight into the injustice and pain of apartheid . Working with a group of black actors ( including Zakes Mokae ) , Fugard wrote his first play No Good Friday . Returning to Port Elizabeth in the early 1960s , he worked with a group of actors whose first performance was in the former snake pit of the zoo , hence the name The Serpent Players . The political slant of his plays bought him into conflict with the government . In order to avoid prosecution , he started to take his plays overseas . After Blood Knot , was produced in England , his passport was withdrawn for four years . In 1962 , he publicly supported an international boycott against segregated theatre audiences which lead to further restrictions . He worked extensively with two black actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona and workshopped three plays viz . Sizwe Bansi Is Dead , The Island and Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act . The early plays workshopped with Kani and Ntshona were staged in black areas for a night and then the cast moved to the next venue – probably a dimly lit church hall or community centre . The audience was normally poor migrant labourers and the residents of hostels in the townships . The plays at this time were political and mirrored the frustrations in the lives of the audience . It really was live theatre – the audience used be drawn in to the drama , applauding , crying and interjecting . The plays were workshopped in the fullest sense of the word . Fugard used the feedback to improve the plays – expanding the parts that worked and deleting some that didn’t . For example in Sizwe Banzi is Dead , migrant worker Bansi can only survive by assuming someone else 's identity and getting the important apartheid pass in order to get a job . When he debates how Sizwe would effectively “die” and whether the sacrifice would be worth it , the audience would cry out “Go on . Do it . ” , because they appreciated that without a pass you were effectively a non - entity . Sets and props were improvised from whatever was available which helps to explain the minimalist sets that productions of these plays utilise . In 1971 , the restrictions
