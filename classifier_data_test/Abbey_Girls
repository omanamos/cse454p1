The Abbey Girls was the second title in the Abbey Series of British novels by Elsie J. Oxenham . They were published between 1914 and 1959 . The first title , Girls of the Hamlet Club set the scene for the school aspects of the series , but it is this title that introduces The Abbey — almost a character in its own right — a romantic ruin that inspires love for it as a quiet , peaceful place , and creates the wish to behave in the public - spirited tradition of the early Cistercian monks . These qualities go some way towards explaining the popularity of the series . The Abbey Girls tells of two red - headed cousins , Joan and Joy Shirley , and how , in different ways , they manage to get places at Miss Macey 's School in Wycombe . These two characters are the original ' Abbey Girls ' and the series continues with stories about them and the friends they make throughout , not only their schooldays , but also their adult lives . An early friend , Jen , soon becomes a major character , and others , Jandy Mac , Rosamund and Maidlin , can all claim the sobriquet ' Abbey Girl ' . By the end of the series these six are all married with children , and the adventures of the daughters of Joan , Joy and Jandy at the same school have come to the fore . There was no ' Abbey School ' as such , although The Girls of the Abbey School tells how the school spent a term in Abinger Hall , the home of one of the cousins , which had a ruined abbey in its grounds . The Abbey was based on Cleeve Abbey in Somerset - an English Heritage Property open to the public in the summer months . Oxenham moved this ruin to Oxfordshire , near the Buckinghamshire border , to tie the cousins in with the characters from the ' first ' book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club ( a 1914 " prequel " ) which was set in the Wycombe school and in surrounding hamlets and villages . Oxenham was an enthusiast of folk dancing and frequently incorporated it into her work ; Folk dancing is mentioned in nearly all 38 Abbey books , and the English Folk Dance Society ( later the English Folk Dance and Song Society ) and its leading members are depicted in some of them , some by real name , others under nicknames . Another theme used throughout the series was that of May Queens . The Hamlet Club chose , towards the end of that book , one of their number as May Queen . By the time of Abbey Girls this has become a tradition in the school of 3 years ' standing , and by the end of the series , in Two Queens at the Abbey the Club is 27 years old and crowning Joy 's twin daughters as the joint 28th Queen . It is thought that the Whitelands College tradition of May Queens , which was inspired by John Ruskin , may in turn have inspired Oxenham , perhaps through someone she had met who had been trained at Whitelands , but no definite connection has been established . Certainly Oxenham herself did not attend the college . 1. Jen of the Abbey School takes place during and after the events of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School and should therefore
