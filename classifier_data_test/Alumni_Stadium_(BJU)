Alumni Stadium is the athletics stadium at Bob Jones University , a Protestant Fundamentalist university in Greenville , South Carolina . The stadium , a gift of the BJU Alumni Association , seats 4,000 in a single stand situated along the north sideline . Its bleachers are constructed of prestressed concrete beams , and the seats are made of anodized aluminium . The University abolished intercollegiate athletics in 1933 , and only intramural sports are played in the stadium , including the University 's intramural soccer final , the Turkey Bowl , which is played the weekend before Thanksgiving . Although an athletic track circles the field , the facility could technically be classed as a soccer - specific stadium because its grass playing field is wide enough for a regulation soccer pitch .
