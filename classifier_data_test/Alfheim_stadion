Alfheim stadion is the home ground of the Norwegian Eliteserie football club Tromsø I.L. . The artificial grass pitch at Alfheim Stadium is the biggest in Norway , being 110 metres long and 70 meters wide . It is also the northernmost Premier Division stadium in Norway , making its under - soil heating a must - have . Alfheim had natural grass until 2006 . However , the condition of the pitch , especially during the winter months , received considerable criticism from sports pundits and visiting managers . Usually around October , when the Eliteserie is in its last rounds , winter sets in in Tromsø . This , along with the wear and tear from football matches and practicing sessions , caused the grass to disappear and reduced the pitch to a muddy field . To make up for this , Tromsø I.L. decided to install artificial turf at the stadium , and did so during the Elitserie - break during the World Cup in Germany . To fund the new turf , Tromsø I.L. received contributions from several businesses in Tromsø , including 7.5 million NOK from an anonymous giver . Some controversy surrounded one of the stands during the 2004 - season . Ringnes , a Norwegian brewery , complained about the clubs S.K. Brann and Tromsø I.L. being sponsored by the breweries Hansa Borg and Mack Brewery respectively . Advertising for alcohol is illegal in Norway . The result of this complaint for Tromsø I.L. was that the club had to remove all advertisements for Mack , including the seating arrangement on one of the stands that spelled out Mack . The seats were changed , making the stands spell out Tack in stead . Tack is a play on words , since it resembles the word Takk , Norwegian for " thank you " , a gesture from Tromsø I.L. thanking Mack for the co - operation through a great deal of years.Ahead of the 2005 - season , the former Mack - stands had been renamed to the Coop - stands , being sponsored by the Norwegian convenience store chain Coop . The stands on the opposite side of the pitch were rebuilt ahead of the 2005 - season , meaning both stands now have roofs . While these stands are seated , the stands behind each goal are for standing supporters , something which is legal in Norwegian football , but illegal for continental competitions . The standing - only stands behind each goal are without a roof . Isberget , Tromsø I.L. 's supporter club stand behind the north - end goal , while the area designated for visiting supporters is behind the south - end goal . Because of Tromsø I.L. 's good home record in many seasons in the Eliteserie ( e.g. 10 wins in 13 matches in the 2004 - season ) , Alfheim Stadium has been given the nickname Fort Alfheim , building on the image of Alfheim Stadium as being impregnable . Chelsea F.C. , Galatasaray , and Red Star Belgrade have all experienced losing to Tromsø I.L. at Alfheim .
