Activision , Inc. NASDAQ : ATVI is an American computer and video game company . Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system , and it is now one of the largest third party video game publishers in the world , second only to Electronic Arts . Prior to the formation of Activision , software for video game consoles was published exclusively by the makers of the systems for which the games were designed . For example , Atari was the only publisher of games for the Atari 2600 . This was particularly galling to the developers of the games , as they received no financial rewards for games that did well , and did n't even receive credit in the manuals . After watching a number of games turn into multi - million - dollar best sellers , a number of programmers decided they had had enough and left . Activision became the first third - party game publisher for game consoles . The company was founded by former music industry executive Jim Levy and former Atari programmers David Crane , Larry Kaplan , Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead . Atari 's company policy at the time was not to credit game creators for their individual contributions ; Levy took the approach of crediting and promoting game creators along with the games themselves . This was an important draw that helped the newly formed company attract experienced talent . Crane , Kaplan , Levy , Miller , and Whitehead received the Game Developers Choice " First Penguin " award in 2003 in recognition of this step . The departure of the four programmers , whose titles made up more than half of Atari 's cartridge sales at the time , caused legal action between the two companies which was not ultimately settled until 1982 . As the market for game consoles started to decline , Activision branched out , producing game titles for home computers as well , and acquiring smaller publishers . In 1982 , Activision released Pitfall ! , which is considered by many to be the first platform game as well as the best selling title on the 2600 . Although the team 's technical prowess had already been proven , it was Pitfall ! that turned them into a huge success . This not only resulted in a legion of clones , including stand - up arcade games , but can be said to have launched the entire platform genre which became a major part of video games through the 1980s . In 1985 , Activision merged with struggling text adventure pioneer Infocom . Jim Levy was a big fan of Infocom 's titles and wanted Infocom to remain solvent . However , about six months after the " InfoWedding " , Bruce Davis took over as CEO of Activision . Davis was against the merger from the start and was heavy - handed in management of them . He also forced marketing changes on Infocom which caused sales of their games to plummet . Eventually , in 1989 , after several years of losses , Activision closed down the Infocom studios in Cambridge , Massachusetts extending to only 11 of the 26 employees an offer to relocate to Activision 's headquarters in Silicon Valley ; five did . In 1988 Activision started to get involved in other types of software besides video games , such as business applications . As a result , Activision changed its corporate name to Mediagenic in order to have a name that would globally represent
