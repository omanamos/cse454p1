A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) is a historical novel by Charles Dickens . The plot centers on the years leading up to the French Revolution and culminates in the Jacobin Reign of Terror . It tells the story of two men , Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton , who look similar but are very different in personality . Darnay is a romantic French aristocrat , while Carton is a cynical English barrister . However , the two are in love with the same woman , Lucie Manette . Other major characters in the book include Dr. Alexandre Manette ( Lucie 's father ) , who was unjustly imprisoned in the infamous Bastille for many years under a lettre de cachet , and Madame Defarge , a female revolutionary with a grudge against the Evrémonde family . Both the novel 's opening ( It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . Jarvis Lorry travels to Dover to meet a young woman , Lucie Manette , in 1775 . When he arrives , he informs her that her father , Doctor Manette , whom she previously believed to be dead , has actually been incarcerated as a prisoner in Paris for the past eighteen years , and has recently been released by the French government . Tellson’s Bank is sending Lorry to identify the doctor ( who had been one of Tellson’s clients ) and bring him to England . The news upsets Lucie greatly ; he tries to comfort her , but Miss Pross takes over when she fears he has frightened Lucie too much . The story shifts abruptly to Saint Antoine , a suburb of Paris , where a cask of wine accidentally splits and spills on the ground .

He sits in a dark room all day making shoes , as he did while in prison . Lucie takes him to England . Five years later ( 1780 ) , Dr. Manette has recovered from his ordeal .

Those testifying against him are a John Barsad and a Roger Cly , who claim that he had been reporting on English troops in North America to the French .

Carton becomes enamoured with Lucie and jealous of Darnay . In Paris , the Marquis St. Evrémonde , Darnay 's uncle , is returning from an audience with Monseigneur , one of the ' greatest lords in France ' , when his coach runs over and kills
