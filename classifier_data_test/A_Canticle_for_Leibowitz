A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post - apocalyptic science fiction novel by Walter M. Miller , Jr. , first published in 1959 . The first section of the book is based on an earlier short story from 1955 . The book won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel . It is set in an abbey in the Southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war , and takes place at intervals of hundreds of years apart as civilization rebuilds itself . The plot combines elements of dark comedy with more serious examinations of the issues surrounding faith , knowledge , and power . The book was inspired by the author 's witnessing of the destruction of the monastery at Monte Cassino during World War II . Fiat Voluntas Tua ( Latin – " Thy Will Be Done , " Matt . Around the end of the 20th century , industrial civilization was destroyed by a nuclear war , known later as the " Flame Deluge " . Subsequently , there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons — the " Simplification " . Anyone of learning , and eventually anyone who could even read , was likely to be killed . Illiteracy became almost universal , and books were destroyed en masse . Isaac Edward Leibowitz had been a Jewish electrical engineer working for the United States military . After surviving the war , he converted to Catholicism and founded a monastic order , the " Albertian Order of Leibowitz " , dedicated to preserving knowledge by hiding books , smuggling them to safety ( booklegging ) , memorizing , and copying them . A principal base for the order was an abbey Leibowitz founded in the American southwestern desert ( near the military base where he had worked before the war ) . The exact location of the abbey is not revealed , but it is on an old road , probably part of the National Highway System , that was " a portion of the shortest route from the Great Salt Lake to Old El Paso " ( Chapter 1 ) . Leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred—he was killed by simultaneous hanging and burning . Later he was beatified and became a candidate for sainthood . Centuries after his death , the Abbey is still preserving the " memorabilia " , the collected writings that have survived the Flame Deluge and the Simplification , in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science . In the 26th century , Brother Francis Gerard of Utah , a novice training to become a monk , is sent out from the Abbey of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz on a Lenten mission of " penance , solitude , and silence " in the desert . While there , Francis encounters a traveler , who points out a rock that might help him complete his shelter . In moving this rock , Francis discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing " relics " , such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts like " pound pastrami , can kraut , six bagels–bring home for Emma " . Brother Francis soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by his order 's founder , the Blessed Leibowitz himself . The discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery , as the other monks see the traveler as a miraculous sign from
