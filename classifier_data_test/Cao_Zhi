Cao Zhi ( Chinese : 曹植 192 – 232 ) was a Chinese poet during the late Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period . His poetry style , greatly revered during the Jin Dynasty and Southern and Northern Dynasties , came to be known as the jian'an style . Cao Zhi was also the son of the powerful warlord Cao Cao . Together with his elder brother Cao Pi , they were the strongest contestants for their father 's position . Cao Pi eventually succeeded Cao Cao in 220 and within a year declared himself the first emperor of the Kingdom of Wei . Like many powerful families , tension among brothers was high . In his later life , Cao Zhi was not allowed to meddle in politics , despite his many petitions to seek office . Born in 192 , Cao Zhi was the third son of the powerful warlord Cao Cao and Princess Bian . According to the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms , Cao Zhi could recite the Shi Jing , Analects and more than ten thousand verses worth of poems before he even turned twenty . His literary talent made him a favorite son of Cao Cao in the early stage of his life . However , Cao Zhi was an impetuous man with little self - discipline . He was also a heavy drinker . On the other hand , his elder brother Cao Pi was a shrewd man who knew how to feign emotions at the right times . Cao Pi also enjoyed a much closer relationship to the servants and subjects around Cao Cao , and they spoke well of him . In 217 , Cao Cao eventually picked Cao Pi to succeed himself . This further aggravated Cao Zhi 's already eccentric behavior . He once rode his chariot along the road reserved for the emperor and through the front gate of the palace . This infuriated his father , who sentenced the chariot driver to death . Having chosen a successor , Cao Cao took measures to emasculate other contestants . He did this by executing Yang Xiu , a chief advisor to Cao Zhi . This greatly unsettled Cao Zhi , but failed to jolt Cao Zhi back to the right track . On the contrary , he sank further into his drunken stupor . In 219 , Cao Cao 's cousin and leading general Cao Ren was besieged at Fancheng ( 樊城 , present day Xiangfan , Hubei ) by the enemy general Guan Yu. Cao Cao named Cao Zhi to lead a relief force to the rescue , with the hope that the task would instill responsibility in the latter . However , Cao Zhi was so drunk that he could not come forth to take the order . Cao Cao then gave up on this son . Within months , Cao Cao died . One of the first things Cao Pi did was to do away with Ding Yi ( 丁仪 ) and Ding Yi ( 丁廙 ) , two firm supporters of Cao Zhi . He also sent Cao Zhi , along with the other brothers , away from the capital and prohibited them from taking part in central political issues or even communicating with one another . Prospects for Cao Zhi did not improve after Cao Pi died in 227 . He wrote to the second Wei emperor Cao Rui many times , seeking a position to apply his talents . In 232 , he even sought a private meeting with Cao Rui
