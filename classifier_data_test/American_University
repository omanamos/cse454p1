American University traces its history to a letter written by George Washington , in which he expressed a desire for a " national university " to be located in the nation 's capital . The university was established in the District of Columbia by an Act of Congress on February 24 , 1893 primarily due to the efforts of Methodist Bishop John Fletcher Hurst .
