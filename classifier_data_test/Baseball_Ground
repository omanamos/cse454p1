The Baseball Ground was a stadium in Derby , UK . It was first used for baseball as the home of Derby County Baseball Club from 1890 until 1898 and then for football ( soccer ) as the home of Derby County F.C. from 1895 until 1997 . As the name suggests , the stadium was originally used for baseball . It was originally called Ley 's Baseball Ground and was part of a complex of sports grounds ( Ley 's Recreation Ground ) built and owned by businessman Sir Francis Ley for workers at his foundry , Ley 's Malleable Castings Vulcan Ironworks . The stadium was the focal point of the complex and was part of a personal quest by Ley to introduce baseball to the UK . The stadium was home to Derby County Baseball Club , which was aligned to the more famous football club . The club ran away with the first championship after the National Baseball League of Great Britain and Ireland was established in 1890 . However , pressure from other teams in the league over the number of American players Derby used forced them to resign at the end of the league 's first season , though the baseball club itself lasted until 1898 . Derby County Football Club had occasionally used the stadium for their home matches and , with their partner baseball club in decline , made it their permanent home in 1895 and renamed it The Baseball Ground . A party of Gypsies were forced to move and legend has it that before leaving they put a curse on the ground preventing Derby County winning the F. A. Cup . The ground became the property of the club in 1924 when it was purchased from Ley for Â£10,000 . At its height , the Baseball Ground could accommodate around 42,000 spectators . The record attendance was 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969 . Later , the stadium was slowly converted to become all - seater and the capacity eventually dropped to 18,300 anf featured several cantilever 3 - tier stands . One end was unique in that it was not completely in line with the pitch . Derby County moved to the brand new Pride Park Stadium in 1997 . The last league match to be played there was against Arsenal , though the stadium continued to be used for reserve team games for a few seasons afterwards . In 2003 , the Baseball Ground was demolished to make way for housing .
