Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College is a coeducational college specializing in agriculture , located in Tifton , Georgia . It is a part of the University System of Georgia , and is named for Abraham Baldwin , the first president of the University of Georgia , Georgia 's first university . Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College was established in 1908 as the Second District A&M School , became South Georgia A&M College in 1924 and Georgia State College for Men in 1929 . Named for a signer of the United States Constitution and the first president of the University of Georgia , the college assumed its present name in 1933 when it became a unit of the University System of Georgia . At that time ABAC embarked on a mission devoted primarily to associate - level studies in agriculture , home economics , and related fields . ABAC 's role later expanded to include a diverse educational program . The Division of Agriculture and Forest Resources is the largest division on campus , and nursing is ABAC 's largest single program major . The college offers 40 college transfer programs in which students move on to four - year colleges and universities after their ABAC careers are complete . Students can also choose from 15 two - year career technological degrees which take them into the job market . Another option is the certificate program , where ABAC offers 19 selections , each of which can be completed in one year . Students live on campus in the ABAC Place apartments , the largest housing project of its kind at a two - year college in America . Most units are four - bedroom , two - bath with a completely furnished kitchen and living area . The units are indeed apartments , rather than traditional dorms . Students are not allowed to leave their doors open in the typical college dormitory style . Unlike many colleges whom manage housing through a third party , all housing at ABAC is directly managed by the Student Life and Housing Office , and order mantained by a comparitavely small number of highly empowered Resident Assistants known as CA 's , along with a coordinator for each building . Additionally , the new ABAC Lakeside complex is being built on the north shore of Lake Baldwin . ABAC Lakeside will provide housing for 489 freshmen when the 2007 fall term begins on Aug. 20 . The rooms at ABAC Lakeside are being built in the suite style , unlike the apartment style housing at ABAC Place . Abraham Baldwin has a variety of athletics for students , with a very strong men 's Tennis team headed by Alan Kramer . The college 's literary magazine , The " Pegasus " , has garnered wide acclaim across the state and the college 's paper , The Stallion , has won many awards among Georgia 's 2 - year college newspapers , while the college also has a radio station , WPLH , an Honors program , and the Arts Station which helps the college bring arts and cultural events to Tift and surrounding counties . After many false starts , the college recently changed sectors from two - year to state college , making it one of the institutions that can offer both two - year and four year programs . Four - year programs have not yet started , however . Notable graduates of ABAC include Cathy Cox , former Secretary of State for the U.S. state of Georgia and a candidate for Governor in
