A Summons to Memphis is a 1986 novel by Peter Taylor which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987 . It is the recollection of Phillip Carver , a middle aged editor from New York City , who is summoned back to Memphis by his two conniving unmmarried sisters to help them prevent the marriage of their elderly father to a younger woman . As the story unfolds , Phillip reflects back on the major incidents in the life of his well - to - do family which was forced to leave Nashville during the time of the Great Depression after the older Mr. Carver , a distinguished lawyer , was betrayed by his business associate Lewis Shackleford . Though this happened when the four Carver children were still in their teens ( another brother , who is little mentioned , died during the D - Day invasion of Normandy in World War II ) , the move had a major impact on them and continues to affect their abilities to build stable relationships and function in the modern world . As in Taylor 's other books , this is a metaphor for the conflict between the lifestyle and values of " Old Tennessee " and the " New South , " which disregards the traditional ways of its former gentried classes . The book is an intense psychological novel which attempts to understand the motivations of each member of the larger Carver family by tracing them back to that one event - - the move to Memphis - - and the sense of dislocation that it caused in all of them . For Phillip , the narrator , the bonds to the past cannot be eliminated , no matter how much he tries to escape his family and live anonymously in New York . For the three surviving children , their feeble efforts to build new lives for themselves are overwhelmed by their sense of familial loyalty until they finally come to terms with the events that shaped them . For the sisters , Betsy and Josephine , this means giving up their teenage lifestyle , which they carried with them well into middle age , and moving back home with their father . For Phillip , it means making peace with the father who disrupted his adolescence and once again recognizing him as a heroic figure . Even Mr. Carver comes to terms with his past when , dining at a spa , he meets Lewis Shackleford one last time and the two men rekindle the friendship that was broken years before . For each of them , it is only when they come to terms with the past that they can achieve the happiness they seek . The novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987 .
