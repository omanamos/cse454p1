Augustana College is a private , liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and located on a rolling 100 - acre ( 400,000 m² ) campus in Sioux Falls , South Dakota . Augustana’s name is from the origin of the Lutheran Church in the Confessio Augustana , the Latin name for the Augsburg Confession of 1530 . The institution was established in 1835 as Hillsboro Academy in Hillsboro , Illinois by Scandinavian immigrants . The school was moved to Springfield , Illinois , where it was renamed Illinois State University . In 1860 , Professor Lars Paul Esbjörn and a group of followers moved to Chicago because of differences over matters of doctrine . As the United States expanded westward , pioneers moved the school to Paxton , Illinois in 1863 ; Marshall , Wisconsin in 1869 ; Beloit , Iowa in 1881 ; and then to Canton , South Dakota in 1888 . Three Lutheran synods united and merged with the Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls in 1918 . The Lutheran Normal School opened in 1889 with the purpose of educating teachers . In 1918 , synod officials felt that having two institutions so close together was not fiscally prudent , and decided to merge the Lutheran Normal School and Augustana College in Sioux Falls under the name Augustana College . After the merger , the school site in Canton became the Augustana Academy . Despite the similarities in name , it was no longer affiliated with the college . The Augustana Vikings participate in NCAA Division II athletics in the North Central Conference . In 2004 - 2005 , Augie wrestlers finished second in the nation in NCAA Division II finals .
