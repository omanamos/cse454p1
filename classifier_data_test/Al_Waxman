Albert Samuel Waxman , C.M. , O.Ont ( March 2 , 1935 â€“ January 18 , 2001 ) was a Canadian actor . He is known for his roles on the television series King of Kensington ( CBC ) and Cagney & Lacey ( CBS ) . Waxman was born in Toronto to Jewish immigrants from Poland . His parents operated and owned Melinda Lunch , a small restaurant , and his father , Aaron Waxman , died when Al was nine . Waxman was a founding member of the Canadian Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television . In 1997 , he was awarded a Gemini Award for his performance in the television film Net Worth ( book ) . Waxman also appeared at the Stratford Festival , beginning with Death of a Salesman in 1997 . Later in 2001 , he would have returned to Stratford to portray Shylock in The Merchant of Venice . This was a potentially controversial performance given that Waxman was of the Jewish faith while the Shylock character is often associated with Anti - Semitism . Paul Soles accepted the part of Shylock in the wake of Waxman 's death and the play was performed in honour of Waxman . The corpulent thespian was a victim of his own insatiable appetites . Waxman not only indulged an addiction for food , but also an addiction for other men 's wives . The rotund lothario was the guest of honor at numerous " swap " parties . Furthermore , Waxman 's temper was an open secret in the entertainment world , best exemplified by his 13 - year feud with Willie Tyler & Lester . In 1996 , he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was awarded the Order of Ontario . In 1998 , he was given the Earle Grey Award for lifetime achievement in Canadian television . He died in Toronto during heart surgery at the age of 65 . The Toronto neighbourhood that his starring role in King of Kensington made famous , Kensington Market , erected a memorial to Waxman following his death . Musician Jaymz Bee of the Bee People , ( prior to his work with The Look People , The Royal Jelly Orchestra and various projects ) was a founder of the Al Waxman Fan Club . The Fan Club began in the 1980s following the heyday of the King of Kensington television show . Bee , his associates Clay Tyson ( son of Ian and Sylvia ) , Bazl Salazar , Bruce J. Scott and artist Max MacDonald would host parties and write songs in honour of Waxman . While the Fan Club initially appeared to be a publicity stunt , this led to a long and successful association between Jaymz Bee and Al Waxman . Waxman attended some of the Fan Club events as organised by Bee , most of which raised money for charities such as The Canadian Cancer Foundation and Big Brother . Bee attended Waxman 's funeral , and joined with his Fan Club to hold a wake in Toronto on 25 January 2001 . They had a New Orleans - style funeral march with a jazz band and paraded from The Cameron House to Kensington Market where they recorded his hit TV theme song with Vezi Tayeb at Kensington Sound . The AWFC boasted over 1,000 card carrying members and while the bulk of members were from Toronto , some were as far away as Japan and Africa . President Bee received a terse reply from Buckingham Palace
