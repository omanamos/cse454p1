Ayn Rand ( IPA : , February 2 1905 – March 6 1982 ) , born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ( Russian : Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум ) , was a Russian - born American novelist and philosopher , best known for creating a philosophy she named " Objectivism " and for writing the novels We the Living , The Fountainhead , Atlas Shrugged and the novella Anthem . Her influential and controversial ideas have attracted both enthusiastic admiration and scathing denunciation . Rand 's writing ( both fiction and non - fiction ) emphasizes the philosophic concepts of objective reality in metaphysics , reason in epistemology , and rational egoism in ethics . In politics she was a proponent of laissez - faire capitalism and a staunch defender of individual rights , believing that the sole function of a proper government is protection of individual rights ( including property rights ) . She believed that individuals must choose their values and actions solely by reason , and that " Man — every man — is an end in himself , not the means to the ends of others. " . According to Rand , the individual " must exist for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself . The pursuit of his own rational self - interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life. " . Rand decried the initiation of force and fraud , and held that government action should consist only in protecting citizens from criminal aggression ( via the police ) and foreign aggression ( via the military ) and in maintaining a system of courts to decide guilt or innocence and to objectively resolve disputes . Her politics are generally described as minarchist and libertarian , though she did not use the first term and disavowed any connection to the second . Rand , a self - described hero - worshiper , stated in her book The Romantic Manifesto that the goal of her writing was " the projection of an ideal man. " . In reference to her philosophy , Objectivism , she said : " My philosophy , in essence , is the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute. " . Rand was born in Saint Petersburg , Russia , and was the eldest of three daughters ( Alisa , Natasha , and Nora ) of Zinovy Zacharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum , agnostic and largely non - observant ethnic Jews . Her father was a chemist and a successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur who earned the extraordinary privilege of living outside the Pale . From an early age , Alisa displayed an interest in literature and film . She started writing screenplays and novels at the age of seven . Her mother taught her French and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys , where Rand found her first childhood hero : Cyrus Paltons , an Indian army officer in a Rudyard Kipling - style story by Maurice Champagne , called " The Mysterious Valley " . Throughout her youth , she read the novels of Sir Walter Scott , Alexandre Dumas , père and other Romantic writers , and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the Romantic movement as a whole . She discovered Victor Hugo at the age of thirteen , and fell deeply in love with his novels . Later ,
