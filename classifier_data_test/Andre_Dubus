Andre Dubus ( August 11 , 1936 - February 24 , 1999 ) was an American short story writer , essayist , and autobiographer . Andre Dubus was born in Lake Charles , Louisiana , the youngest child of a Cajun - Irish Catholic family . His surname is pronounced " Duh - BYOOSE " with the accent on the second syllable to rhyme with " muse. " . Dubus grew up in the Bayou country in Lafayette , Louisiana and was educated by the Christian Brothers , a Catholic parochial school that emphasized literature and writing . Dubus graduated from nearby McNeese State College in 1958 as a journalism and English major . Dubus then spent six years in the Marine Corps , rising to the rank of captain , at which time he married for the first time and began his family . After leaving the Marine Corps , Dubus moved with his wife and four children to Iowa City , where he later graduated from the University of Iowa 's Iowa Writers ' Workshop with an MFA in creative writing . After receiving his MFA , Dubus taught briefly in the South , but soon became disgusted by its social conditions and rampant racism . Dubus moved to the northeast and from 1966 to 1984 taught at Bradford College in Massachusetts . His teaching loads were high and his salary low , but as Dubus needed to support his family as well as continue his career as a writer , and so remained there for almost twenty years . In 1984 , Dubus experienced chest pains and shortness of breath . Originally diagnosed as a mild heart attack , these symptoms were later recognised as reactions to stress and exhaustion . Dubus resigned from Bradford , and later taught at the University of Alabama and at Boston University . Andre Dubus 's life was scarred by tragedy . His sister was raped as a young woman , causing Dubus many years of paranoia over his loved ones ' safety . Dubus carried personal firearms to protect himself and those around him , until the night in the late 1980s , when he almost shot a man in a drunken argument outside a bar in Tuscaloosa , Alabama . In his essay " Giving up the Gun " , published in The New Yorker , Dubus describes that night as the point at which he decided to stop arming himself and to take a less defensive - and perhaps less hostile - view of life . Dubus experienced a personal tragedy late on the night of July 23 , 1986 , when he was seriously injured in a car accident . He was driving from Boston to his home in Haverhill , Massachusetts and he stopped to assist two disabled motorists - - brother and sister Luis and Luz Santiago . As Dubus assisted the injured Luz to the side of the highway , an oncoming car swerved and hit them . Luis was killed instantly ; Luz survived because Dubus had pushed her out of the way . Dubus himself was critically injured . As a result of the accident , both Dubus 's legs were crushed . His left leg had to be amputated above the knee , and Dubus would eventually lose the use of his right leg . Dubus would spend three painful years undergoing a series of operations , and extensive physical therapy . Despite his efforts to walk with a prosthesis , chronic infections confined him to a wheelchair for the remainder
