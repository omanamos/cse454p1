Anton Pann ( born Antonie Pantoleon - Petroveanu , and also mentioned as Anton Pantoleon or Petrovici ; 1790s—November 2 , 1854 ) , was an Ottoman - born Wallachian composer , musicologist , and Romanian - language poet , also noted for his activities as a printer , translator , and schoolteacher . Pann was an influential folklorist and collector of proverbs , as well as a lexicographer and textbook author . Pann was born sometime between 1794 and 1798 , in Sliven , Rumelia ( in today 's Bulgaria ) . According to some accounts , his mother , Tomaida , was an ethnic Greek , while his father , Pantoleon Petrov , was of uncertain ethnic affiliation — it is known that he worked as a a coppersmith bucket - maker , which makes it likely that he was a Romani of the Kalderash caste . In Romania , the latter view is notably supported by Roma community activists , who cite Pann among the most prominent Romani artists . Various other interpretations state that Pantoleon Petrov , who died during Anton Pann 's childhood , was Bulgarian , Aromanian , or Romanian . The writer , who was the youngest of Petrov and Tomaida 's three sons , eventually adopted the family name Pann , as a colloquial contraction of his father 's given name . After he began primary education at the communal school in Sliven , the Petrovs fled the region during the Russo - Turkish War of 1806 - 1812 and settled in Chişinău , Bessarabia , where Anton was first employed by a Russian Orthodox choir . His two brothers were killed in the skirmishes around Brăila , as volunteers on the Imperial Russian side . Moving with his mother to Bucharest in 1810 - 1812 , Pann would spent most of his life in the city . Anton Pann carried on with his choral activities in Wallachia , was employed as a sexton by the Romanian Orthodox Olari and Sfinţilor Churches , before being tutored by Dionisie Fotino and allowed to attend the religious music school founded by Petru Efesiul ( 1816 ) . Perfecting his craft , he came to the attention of Metropolitan Dionisie Lupu , who appointed him on a commission charged with translating liturgical works from Slavonic to Romanian . The memoirist Ion Ghica later recounted that Pann attended the Saint Sava College , but this remains disputed . In 1820 , he first got married to a woman named Zamfira Azgurean , in what was to be the first of his unhappy romantic liaisons . In 1821 , when Tudor Vladimirescu 's rebellious forces occupied the city , Pann fled to the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt ( part of the Austrian Empire ) , and was employed as a cantor by the Saint Nicolas Church in the ethnic Romanian neighborhood of Şchei . This temporary refuge over the Southern Carpathians mirrored that of other cultural and religious figures of the day , his fellow musician Macarie Ieromonahul among them . He also spent time in Râmnicu Vâlcea ( 1827 ) , where he was a teacher at the Orthodox seminary and , in parallel , lectured on religious music to the nuns of the Dintr - un Lemn Monastery . A scandal erupted after Pann used his position at the latter institution to seduce Anica , the mother superior 's 16 - year - old niece . Unsuccessfully offering her legal guardians to marry Anica in church , he eloped with her back to Şchei .
