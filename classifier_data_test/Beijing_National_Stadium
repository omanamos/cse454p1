The Beijing National Stadium , also known as the bird 's nest , will be the main track and field stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics and will be host to the Opening and Closing ceremonies . In 2002 Government officials engaged architects worldwide in a design competition . Pritzker Prize - winning architects Herzog & de Meuron collaborated with ArupSport and China Architecture Design & Research Group to win the competition . Contemporary Chinese artist , Ai Weiwei , is the Artistic Consultant for design . The stadium will seat as many as 100,000 spectators during the Olympics , but this will be reduced to 80,000 after the games . It has replaced the original intended venue of the Guangdong Olympic Stadium . The stadium is 330 metres long by 220 metres wide , and is 69.2 metres tall . The 250,000 square metre ( gross floor area ) stadium is to be built with 36 km of unwrapped steel , with a combined weight of 45,000 tonnes . The stadium will cost up to 3.5 billion yuan ( 422,873,850 USD / 325,395,593 EUR ) . The ground was broken in December 2003 , and construction started in March 2004 , but was halted by the high construction cost in August 2004 . In the new design , the roof of the stadium had been omitted from the design . Experts say that this will make the stadium safer , whilst reducing construction costs . The construction of the Olympic buildings continued once again in the beginning of 2005 . The stadium 's appearance is one of synergy , with no distinction made between the facade and the superstructure . The structural elements mutually support each other and converge into a grid - like formation - almost like a bird 's nest with its interwoven twigs . The spatial effect of the stadium is novel and radical , yet simple and of an almost archaic immediacy , thus creating a unique historical landmark for the Olympics of 2008 . The stadium was conceived as a large collective vessel , which makes a distinctive and unmistakable impression both from a distance and when seen from up close . It meets all the functional and technical requirements of an Olympic National Stadium , but without communicating the insistent sameness of technocratic architecture dominated by large spans and digital screens . Visitors walk through this formation and enter the spacious ambulatory that runs full circle around the stands . From there , one can survey the circulation of the entire area including the stairs that access the three tiers of the stands . Functioning like an arcade or a concourse , the lobby is a covered urban space with restaurants and stores that invite visitors to stroll around . Just as birds stuff the spaces between the woven twigs of their nests with a soft filler , the spaces in the structure of the stadium will be filled with inflated ETFE cushions . Originally , on the roof , the cushions were to be mounted on the outside of the structure to make the roof completely weatherproof , but the roof has been omitted from the design in 2004 . While the rain was to be collected for rainwater recuperation , the sunlight was to filter through the translucent roof , providing the lawn with essential ultraviolet radiation . On the facade , the inflated cushions will be mounted on the inside of the structure where necessary , e.g. to provide wind protection . Since all of the facilities - - restaurants
