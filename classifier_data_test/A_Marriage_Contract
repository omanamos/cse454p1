A Marriage Contract ( written in 1835 and sometimes translated as A Marriage Settlement ) is a novel from Honoré de Balzac’s La Comédie humaine . It tells the story of the marriage of a young Parisian gentleman , Paul de Manerville , to the beautiful but spoiled young Spanish heiress , Natalie Evangelista . It is one of the Scènes de la vie privée , a subset of La Comédie and is set in Bordeaux . Paul de Manerville is a gentleman born of wealth and nobility who decides , over the objections of his worldly friend de Marsay , to give up his elegant bachelor’s life and get married at the age of twenty - seven . He falls in love with a beautiful Spanish girl named Natalie Evangelista , the daughter of a proud Spanish matriarch whose financial assets have been diminishing ever since the death of her husband . Too naïve and full of illusions to see the hidden motives of Natalie Evangelista’s mother , who wants Paul’s wealth in order to procure for her daughter the lavish lifestyle she believes to be her birthright , or to recognize that his bride’s loyalty is entirely with her mother and not with him , Paul gets himself stuck in a frigid and childless marriage . So strong are his illusions , that even at the end of the novel he remains unaware of his wife’s infidelities . A Marriage Contract is one of Balzac’s great studies of human illusions , in this case the illusions of married life . The novel is notable for treating not only the courtship leading up to the marriage , but the negotiations which follow . A Marriage Contract also has one of Balzac’s classic dissections of the techniques and wiles of professional negotiators .
